but they built up
Here's how the house looks all put back together. Now to find the spot to hang it! This is nothing as cool and exciting as Clare's or Randy's honeybees, but it's as close to beekeeping as we will get. I hope the early spring Mason bees will help get our pear trees pollinated this year. I will be sure to post and let you all know how it goes.

What beautiful Symmetry...
and through some of the interviews she's given I gathered the following:
Anyway Paris is only an hour away, close enough to go out to dinner or to the theatre, or to go on a shopping spree, but maybe with 8 pairs of jeans in my wardrobe I don't need to go shopping that often (that bit is to please my husband, Arnaud!)
I want to lay down and die.
CONTRAST CLAUSE: This is not the same as the DrZap version uploaded previously, which has fallen off the tracker. This recording is from a different taper in a different location.
This is fine and I am great at running point on the parenting front.
Internalize the joy of others. I pray that God will help me learn to do what Jack did…. To find my own joy in the joy of others. I want to relish other people’s happiness regardless of my own circumstances, like Jack did. My beloved nephew Jack was unimaginably selfless for a 12 year old. Jack found the secret to lasting joy. Borrow it from others and keep it forever.
Okay, I promise not to stay away so long this time... did I make it up with all my "love" projects? Sort of? ;;)
More of the same, as the comic is in great shape at the moment.
Another reason to love fall? The produce choices available in this season just can’t be beat. So in honor of this fabulous time of year, where there are Apples! Pumpkins! Squash! All sorts of root vegetables! I thought it might be nice to focus on fall produce recipes for the next few weeks.
After browning about a pound of venison with garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, chives, diced orange and green pepper, dried onion flakes, a bit of water (to de-glaze the pot/pan) I add ketchup, mustard and brown sugar to taste/consistency. Most recipes call for dried mustard but yellow mustard worked fine as I couldn’t locate mine in my messy spice cupboard. The meat does tend to set up a bit as it cooks. Be careful not to overcook if using venison and any ground meat (beef, turkey) will work fine just be sure to drain/rinse the meat if it is too greasy.
Okay, so maybe he wasn’t outside in a field, but here is this man with a BABY handing out scantrons. THIS IS MY LIFE. I think my mouth was open when he handed me the scantron.
He didn’t find what he was looking for, put all the items back in the box and pushed it back towards the clerk.
You are just mad because you lost and you know I always win, he said. No. No, that’s not it. I am angry at the injustice the two of you exercise, my still legal husband and former good friend who I confided in all the while she was busy “collecting” for her own agenda. Under NO circumstances would HER ex (if she’d ever had a relationship, that is) EVER get me to climb into the sack with him so he could tell her former bestie “I won.” I am hurting to the core because I was abused not just by one of you but by the TWO of you. He is abusing her just to get to me. Even now. But she is even sillier than I was at 19 and who am I to interfere with her belief of ALL of his lying. Of course, she lied, too. To herself and to me whilst titillating her ego with thoughts of true love. The only thing psychopaths truly love is THEMSELVES.
On 2 November 2010, the Amsterdam Regional Court found in favour of Mercis Media. It ordered Sanrio: (a) to stop to any production, sale and marketing of Cathy character goods in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg; and (b) to pay €25,000/day if it did not comply, up to a maximum of €2m.
Here are a few examples of how much they are alike.

I've been wanting to use this gorgeous Ching Chou Kuik design for a while and I wanted to make a richly-coloured, detailed, Eastern-influenced card. My starting point for this card, other than the image, was digging out my scrummy Taj Mahal paper stack and choosing the gorgeous, glittered, patterned background paper. I coloured the image to coordinate with the paper, using my Promarkers, metallic Promarkers and also some Cosmic Shimmer Acrylic Drawing Inks for added shimmer.

A few weeks ago there was talk that Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu had enlisted Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel to pressure US Prez Barack Obama on Jerusalem, where 1,600 new housing units for Jews have been authorized against international law. Shortly afterwards, Wiesel published an ad in The International Herald Tribune, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal under the title "For Jerusalem." Basically it was a regurgitation of Hasbara clichés designed to explain why the Jews have more right to the city than others. The piece has been thoroughly picked apart and responded to elsewhere, so I'll only give you a taste of it before I proceed with my own critique of the paragraph that particularly irked me.

The March 2012 Glymm Box was initially disappointing, but I thought better of half of the products after some use. So far, the April 2012 Glymm Box is not overly impressive – we’ll see how it goes after I try some of these out. May 2012 may just be my last Glymm Box, if I don’t feel better about this box and the next one doesn’t wow me.
I climbed the highest mountain
You know, the demented psychotic blind fools praising the ANC government for supposedly building houses (for illegal immigrants) and supplying electricity (which is never paid for by those “previously disadvantaged”), never care to tell the other side of the story. Like the liberal socialist left, the truth remains a scarce commodity.

I’ve recently also found myself referencing Dexter’s Laboratory (anyone?) saying “omelette du fromage” and anytime I say “cool,” I feel like I should continue it with the extra “cool cool cool” as Abed does in Community.
This report provides information regarding some missing radioactive wastes, but only deals with tiny amounts of missing weapons production inventories.
But of all our Signal Corps images, the one that has surprised me the most is this one:
you look for me,
I enjoy having the sense of completion and feeling of accomplishment. It’s like finishing a book and placing it on the bookshelf. “These are the books I have read,” the shelf sort of declares. They have been completed… they are not on going. When you get to the last page, more pages just don’t appear and have the story continue on. Even chapters in the book come to an end.

Obviously, the President has spent time giving this issue serious consideration, and his view has been shaped by conversations with his family, his friends, neighbors, and the people who work with him at the White House.
There are some days where I feel like I carry our entire house in my diaper bag because Hannah is always shoving toys in it...but most days, I just carry the basics.
First I drift with the tide, then pull for the shore.
Finally for dessert there is Apple Cranberry Crunch, Hazelnut Cream Cookies (who doesn’t love cookies) and No-Bake Chocolate Mousse Pie (No-baking involved…seriously!)
There is structure to this ceremony, but there is also room for small changes.
Concerned.
The Universal Human is connected through the heart to the whole of life, evolving consciously and helping to co-create a new kind of spiritual path, something we’ve never experienced before, but which is perfect for our time.

BRONKHORSTSPRUIT: Elderly Visser couple (84 and 65) attacked on their smallholding with a pipe and scissors.
As the characters in Little Women illustrate the many perspectives of women’s search for identity and the discovery of the roles they chose, most women choose the traditional roles of marriage and motherhood. But as Jo took on the role of marriage to Mr. Bhaer, and motherhood in the form of her boy’s school in Little Men, she did not give up her own identity in the calling. She depicted the multiplexity of a woman’s role without denying the traditions associated with womanhood, or the new found strength and dignity of her own identity. Women, like Jo, could not deny a part of themselves to find another. She had to have the independence to discover every aspect of her being and to develop each component in her own way. Whether wife, mother, writer, teacher, or any other role in which many women find themselves, Alcott’s Little Women is a classic that showed the importance of womanhood’s many different roles, without denying any part of womanhood itself.
Festivals may be proliferating, but big festivals in particular are increasingly looking the same. They’re more and more like Formula 1 or tennis – the same people flying into hotels, giving the same talk and moving on. That was one reason I started Not the Oxford Literary Festival, which this year celebrated its third outing bigger and better than ever – celebrating local authors, self-publishers, politically engaged writing and spoken – the things that the city’s other festival wouldn’t look at.
So, The Chronicles of Narnia starts out as a seemingly fun kid's adventure series, where four siblings are sent away to the country during the bombing of WWII London. The sibs run around, making up games, playing hide and go seek, and stumble upon the magical world of Narnia. Although I knew and was expecting Christian undertones in the series, it wasn't heavy-handed, and honestly I didn't grasp it all until I saw how it was portrayed in the movie. Ok, Christian undertones, no biggie, it's not preachy, so you can read it with or without the subtext. That is, until you get to the end of the series, when it is blatantly Christian.
Chris: Oh now this is just brutal… she just added that if his voice was as big as his dick, that even the world’s greatest microphone couldn’t help him! OUCH again!
And although it has been proposed that finding a different backsplash could work, I really love the classic look a subway tile gives. The subway tile I showed yesterday as I mentioned was the subway tile from when we did our washroom renovation in the basement. We found the brightest white subway tile around for that shower. Without thinking, I assumed that the brightest white subway tile from the washroom was going to be the same tile for the kitchen. But as you saw in yesterdays post, the brightest white tile made the Ikea Adele cabinet appear yellow. Bleh.

Advocates said that chaining dogs is legal in many areas but takes away their ability to run away, making them more likely to bite people.
Annie and Buster Fang have spent most of their adult lives trying to distance themselves from their famous artist parents. But when a bad economy and a few bad personal decisions converge, the two siblings have nowhere to turn but their family home. Reunited under one roof for the first time in more than a decade, Buster and Annie are forced to confront not only their creatively ambitious parents, but the chaos and confusion of their childhood. Written with wit and honesty, Kevin Wilson‘s The Family Fang (Ecco) is “a comedy, a tragedy, and a tour de force….The best single-word description would be genius” (Ann Patchett).

But I try never to do that. Because the news is so damn depressing. And a person who battles depression should not surround themselves with depressing things. (That's not to say I don't care about these things; I just can't deal with them.)

The circumstances out of which this poem originated are not known in detail. Albert Barnes, and old Protestant commentator writes: “It is not possible now to ascertain on what occasion this psalm was composed, or who was its author. It has been generally believed that it was written in the later periods of the Jewish history, and after the captivity in Babylon. There is no improbability in the supposition, though there is nothing so marked in the psalm as to make this supposition necessary. It is evident from Ps 115:2-3, that it was composed in a time of national calamity, and especially of such national disaster as might lead the surrounding nations to say of them that they were forsaken by the God whom they worshipped.”
With the rise of corporate agriculture receiving the majority of government subsidies and the class divide growing between the poor and the under-taxed rich, a once great nation (and possibly a great one again should they wake up before its too late) is stumbling and sacrificing their own future by ignoring the most important resource their children and their citizens.

However, after a few days, I realized that my statistics were missing in Webmaster Tools, Analytics, and Quantcast.
Civilized people need to stop acting like spoiled little children who toss themselves on the floor and throw tantrums because their mommies won’t give them ice cream.
Basically, pre-capitalist nostalgia. So even with lots of scheming, it still clear that swords make blood, even as there’s lots of play to understand what a social role means, since the contexts and stakes were much clearer than today, but perhaps its the dissolution of them in all the scheming which makes them resonate so nicely with today. Such narratives also often have ways of getting around issues of race, at least as they manifest in America, and hence provide some wish fulfillment. On all fronts, it’s clear to me that the popularity of ‘men with swords/women in court’ dramas is that it provides a counterpoint to the much more ambiguous needs of our age, even as it reflects this nevertheless.

I am happy to continue into the second year. One big change will occur though: instead of publishing African photos, I will now include pics from all over the world. Still including Africa, but also opening the doors of possibility and diversity.

4. Oscillo/Oscillococcinum: This homeopathic can be used at the first sign of the flu to shorten its duration and lessen the severity of its symptoms. Or, you can take it during the flu for a similar effect, though it does work better at the beginning. It lasts for a while so keeping one box on hand is a good idea so you won’t have to run to the store when you feel yucky.

Finally, the 'devil' was lured close enough to be shot, and at the denouement it was revealed to be an unexpectedly large specimen of a creature not generally encountered in those parts. But what exactly was that creature? Only at the end was its English name finally given, and it proved to be a species that, as a young child, I had never heard of before – the wolverine.
The TTC is working with Pattison One in putting up digital signs on the platform. In most stations there is one per direction. In other stations there are two and in a few there are three. These are mostly an ad/news feed system with about the bottom 1/4 (maybe even 1/5) dedicated to TTC information. That information consists of next train arrival, delays, bus routes modifications, etc. The bulk of the display is taken up with, as mentioned, ads and news feeds. Although interesting, and a source of revenue for the TTC, they could be better used as pure information about the TTC. And there should be a minimum of three per station and for the busier platforms, five.

I wanted to post some of the tweaking I have been doing this week in the house. I don't know why, but everything I did I am not quite satisfied with. I guess I am in a mood. So you may see some more tweaking in the near future.
Chuck, the father sitting next to me, controlled the 30 second clock and the two of us usually talked as much about the varsity team as the JV team playing before us. His son was an outstanding defensive lineman who led the team in every statistic; most tackles, most sacks, most recovered fumbles, etc. Chuck’s son was proud of his accomplishments, and everyone knew it. The father was proud of the son, and everyone knew it. Both of them were constantly being lavished with praise and high fives, all of it well deserved.
It was lovely to let the hens out today after the constant rain we have had recently, and even better to discover that I could still keep an eye on them when I am up in my attic doing a bit of writing. I've never noticed that before as when I get to my desk, I hardly move until I have finished what I am working on.
It got me thinking.
There are the well past menopausal woman in their late fifties and sixties giving birth to children they will mostly likely not be able to see get married or even graduate from high school. Children they know will grow up caring for them. Having the child for your daughter who is unable to conceive is one thing – having a child because it can be done is another.
Howard Brenton and David Hare's Brassneck, begins in 1945 and ends in 1973, and Hare's Plenty moves from 1943 to the 1960s; from a prologue after the War to an epilogue in Mrs. Thatcher's Britain of the 1980s. These Marxist dramatists tried to create an alternative history of contemporary Britain.

We all will be surprised by the impact that generosity has both on us, as well as the others we bless. The way out of ourselves, is by investing into the lives of others. Take advantage of the opportunities to be generous this Holiday Season. May our generosity be gauged by the degree of Christ’s generosity to us!
Back out on the roads tomorrow morning.

You can decide to give yourself a good day or a bad day, no matter where you are. It is all a matter of perspective. Everyone has a spirit and a soul, the place where your I AM Presence resides within you. If your spirit/soul/Divine connection left you, you would be dead. Physically dead. But you are not. You are reading this.
To fill out the description of what I do in my classes, I’ll muse about both parts (type and agent) and describe what my students use.
Bill Scald is a restaurant critic (and what a wonderful name for a critic!). Much to his disgust his boss orders him to review a new Italian restaurant that is clearly owned as a money-laundering site by a mob family. Scald points out that in this case a bad review could have extremely nasty results. His editor, blithely uninterested in such niceties as journalistic integrity, tells him to go off and say something nice.
One of the suit’s original plaintiffs was Paula Reid, the Secret Service’s newly-promoted head of South American operations, and the one who blew the whistle on agents’ contact with prostitutes in Colombia. Reid, who is black, gave a statement alleging that black agents were given lesser assignments than their white coworkers. She also told USA Today in 1997 that her supervisors often overlooked her in favor of male agents.
Well, that was an experience.
