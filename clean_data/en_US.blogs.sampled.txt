so anyways, i am going to share some home decor inspiration that i have been storing in my folder on the puter. i have all these amazing images stored away ready to come to life when we get our home.
In 2002, the American Association of Poison Control Centers launched a nationwide toll-free hotline for prevention and treatment of poisonings. The number is (800) 222-1222. In the case of any suspected poisoning emergency, they can be contacted 24 hours a day.
So, this is what is on my sleek, shiny, new refrigerator. I’ve only been here since October, and my kitchen now feels like me.

Posey Osterhagen is not a hottie. She’s about 107 pounds soaking wet, with a cow-lick that refuses to be tamed, and a complete inability to dress like a girl. This is a slight improvement over her high school self. Now, no need to feel sorry for Posey. She’s a completely happy, business-owning, big dog loving woman who has had a wonderful childhood and is still surrounded by a loving family and group of friends.

I guess that’s neither anger nor disgust, but bitterness.
If he were traveling with a British passport that would provide proof that he was born in Kenya on August 4, 1961, not in Hawaii as he claims.. And if he were traveling with an Indonesian passport that would tend to prove that he relinquished whatever previous citizenship he held, British or American, prior to being adopted by his Indonesian step-father in 1967 … MORE HERE
It's been almost two years since I was elected president of my chapter. This time in my life was incredibly special and the entirety of my experience truly shaped the woman I am today. However, when I think back to the day I was elected there is very little I remember - I was scared and nervous, and excited - and yet one piece of that day remains very clear and distinct in my mind. In waiting to hear the results of the election, what must have been only a few minutes felt completely infinite, as if I was waiting for hours. I had made myself vulnerable to my chapter sisters, for what truly was the first time. In waiting to hear the news I was on the verge of tears - in my 20 years I had never had much success with stuff like this. Then without thought or hesitation, one of my sisters reached out and took my hand. Whether she voted for me or not - I didn't know, and I didn't really care - because I knew something much more important. She was there for me, and no matter what decision had been made by the chapter, that wouldn't change. Without saying a word the touch of her hand told me that I didn't have to be afraid or nervous alone.
Up before the sun to see one of the great wonders of the world. There is such a rush to see the famous Machu Picchu, that all the camps woke around 4:00 to get to the first check point which is approximately 20 minutes hike from the campsite.
Pour the lime filling evenly into the completely cooled crust. Bake for 15 minutes or until the center is set but still 'jiggly' when shaken (yes, that's a precise, official cooking term). Remove from oven and allow to cool to room temperature. Refrigerate at least 3 hours before serving. Serve chilled.
Tuesday – Toad in the hole with roasted new potatoes and vegetables
The acting was stellar on all accounts. The biggest standout was Joan Allen who portrayed her sadness and aggravation with a realistic flair. It was also interesting to see Tobey Maguire, Christina Ricci, Katie Holmes and Elijah Wood as young actors. They definitely showcase their talents, especially Tobey Maguire, with his surprisingly large bong hit.
Weekends were for lazing around, not for more work and running all over God’s green acre. She and Trey had been married for two year but they still had plenty of spark between them, and neither had as much as changed out of their PJ’s or left the bedroom for more than a bowl of cereal all weekend. Minerva was sore, but a good sore.
If you want your leg-coverings to let the world know that you’ve got a few quid and don’t care who knows it, or that you have some big ideas about what’s on at the ICA right now - or simply that you are completely insane (but in a mainly non-stabby way) - then you’d better get your wife or girlfriend to take those jeans and chinos down to the charity shop post-haste! Because there’s only one type of trousers you’ll be wanting to wear, and that’s RED TROUSERS. In fact - if you can’t wear red trousers you’d be better off wearing NO TROUSERS AT ALL. That’s what I say. *quid = pounds

After that Ilion the superb was burned.
But I will say that this scene grows out of my experience as an assistant D.A. My first assignment was in Lowell, a great community where Elliot’s and Birke’s were real places. (Elliot's is still going strong and I highly recommend it. Order a hot dog "all around." You won't be sorry.) And the stabbing described in this scene is based on an incident that occurred while I was there — a man gashed across the belly, forced to hold his intestines inside by holding his hand over his belly, pressing it closed, while he was driven to the emergency room. As for the salesman, well, it was my own grandfather who sold Mighty Mac parkas to old stores like Birke’s all over New England. As a writer you grab what you can from any source available, your own history or the lives of others, and you spin it into your story.
it has been a little crazy around here these past weeks, the heatwave, shed distractions, another birthday, lots of lego, lego cake....(pressure!) lego party (more pressure!).......school decisions...(even more pressure!)

When I was in first grade I was reading at pretty much a high-school level, and I got in trouble for bringing this book to school. While the other kids were watching Dick & Jane run after Spot and Sally, I was reading the killer-Santa-Claus story. Later my grandma caught me reading The Exorcist. I don't think it did me any damage, though, really. "Let Jesus fuck you!" was pretty much how I was viewing Southern Baptist society, anyway.
I didn't do it myself.

Right now, bundlers who bundle checks bigger than $200 have to disclose, but there's no limit on how much you can bundle."
So for my birthday back in March, I asked for 2 ceiling lights to be installed in the kitchen, the kitchen walls to be painted and a backsplash to be put up. Well, everything had been done except for the backsplash. I couldn't make up my mind between 3 different ones for several weeks, but finally just had to make a decision.
no not the half painted walls ....

Hey - it's my turn to showcase another one of Janice's great images... just in time for Easter, here comes this great Easter Bundle... Just soooo adorable!
Congrats! Both winners have been emailed and have until Friday 11th March to get back to me with their choice and mailing info so I can get their books on the way, or I'll pick new winners.
but be concerned for this
Another reason I don't believe this will happen, is case and point in my town, we're pretty segregated. This town is overwhelmingly white. There is no black side of town, because there aren't enough black people to have one. I know my town isn't some anomaly, but I would venture to say, most places are self imposed segregated. So if you are a minority in a particular place, and businesses decide to discriminate against a minority, it wouldn't matter to them, and you will be left driving further and being inconvenienced simply because your skin tone isn't pleasing to a business owner.
I'm liking the bright green backdrop of these pictures! The weather has been really nice lately. It's that time of year right before it gets realllly hot down here and where the humidity starts to kick, so we're outside as much as possible.

Again. A ball is rolling. Only God has any clue how it can be stopped. I think for now..sure ...do what we can...cut back...ect ect. But stop bashing those that work out there to support their families, and basically make products you use EVERY DAY!!!
The month of December is upon us and with it, a whole hoopla of stuff to do. In other words....
And as for me, I resumed work apologizing for the days of absence. Fran and I took a little trip to Iloilo to visit old churches, and I went back to hanging out and clubbing with my friends. Life was slowly returning back to normal.
Drinkers who delight in cocktails are going to adore home-grown American whiskeys whether they’re aged in oak or not.
Situation got chaotic as we were trying to run away from the tear gas(the riot police vehicle with the water cannon were still behind the barricades). However, in the chaos, I saw something else. We were sharing salt & water and young men helping old people to move away from the tear gas. In front of me I saw a Unit Amal Malaysia man protecting an old chinese uncle shouting "Ada orang tua!" to make sure that nobody pushed him.
Five men, at least three of them self-described anarchists, have been arrested in an alleged plot to blow up a bridge near Cleveland, the FBI said today.
A bit about me- daughter, wife, mom, breast feeding, natural curl having, thinking about naturopathing, licensed social working woman. I am surrounded by love at all times and I smile when I think about it. Four of my loves! (my husband doesn't like to take pictures but there are a couple of him buried somewhere in my posts!) ;)

Overall then Undead Nightmare is a must buy if you loved Red Dead Redemption. You will easily get your money’s worth from the campaign alone but the multiplayer additions are definitely worth checking out – killing Zombies has never been so much fun!
No, I’m not going to give you wise words by Confucius or a thought from Eleanor Roosevelt. Both are fabulous people you see quoted every day on the bottom of people’s e-mails, and gracing Twitter and Facebook. Personally, I am fan all of uplifting quotes, but those aren’t the kinds of quotes I’m thinking about right now. This week I embarked upon my least favorite authorial task-soliciting cover quotes from other authors.
Every day I look out for you.

To me, signing your life over to the military is a true act of leadership. It is more than just swearing to protect the United States of enemies, both foreign and domestic. They must go through physical and mental training, familial separation and even anthrax shots and gas chambers. They do all this to protect our country.
Sitges is an old fishermen town where gathered the bohemian artists of the first generation of the Catalan Modernist Movement, and where also built their houses the immigrants that came back rich from America. More about this site here.
I hung the snowflakes in place by first drilling holes into the studs and screwing C hooks into the walls. I strung silver wire between the hooks, and suspended the snowflakes at varying heights from the wire using mono-filament. You could barely tell that the wire and mono-filament were there, creating exactly the magical indoor flurry of snowflakes I had imagined.

I want to try to blog a bit more faithfully while we're away, so hopefully stay tuned for some more updates next week. This week, I'm sure, will be devoted to frantic packing and cleaning before we ship out for three weeks.

I never heard my dad yell and I never saw him get angry. He worried about my sister and I and he would have done anything for us. His love was unconditional. My dad was compassionate, peaceful, spiritual, funny, loving and creative. I truly admired him.

The papers are all from a gorgeous Basic Grey collection called 'Kissing Booth' - love those papers.
Seventh, as a result of point six, this election really and truly is (imho) the most important election in the last fifty years. We are standing at the edge of a precipice, and there is little time for turning back. Either our next president cuts programs, agencies and spending, or we go over the edge. This is not a time for merely standing on the sidelines. This is not a time for merely watching and hoping. This is a situation. ”Houston, we have a problem.” We must make drastic changes, and I firmly believe that any one of the GOP candidates will do a better job in Washington than Obama has done. We do not have a choice. We have a duty, and sometimes the duty of an American is a difficult one. Sometimes there’s not a “good choice” for getting out of a pinch. Sometimes we have to be willing to make tough decisions, and without a doubt, if it comes down to Obama and a not-so-conservative candidate, we must actually choose between the lesser of the two evils. God will change this world, and each election year where He gives us an opportunity to prevent immediate self-destruction, we must take that opportunity as He is continuing to do a greater work in our culture. And culture-building will make a difference.
“I’ll be back with help.” He says and leaves.
I'm so glad too, because it was pretty rough going their for a year when the girls didn't get along.
To me, this is true. People are always saying ‘leave me alone for some peace and quiet!’. But really, there can still be chaos around those that want to be peaceful. They just have to block it out in their mind. It’s quite simple really. Quotes like this fascinate me because of the way it is written. Many people are told off by others by the things they say. Although, sometimes you have to think about the way they have said it. Maybe if they said it in a different way then they might not have been told off. Just think about that next time someone says something you think you don’t agree with.
He is SUPER funny and says hilarious things!!
And another one:
Central to His message is: who He said He is and what He came to do. We must either dismiss Him as a liar or fall at His feet and worship Him.
I’ve noticed most organizing books say the same rhetoric as the organizing book before it. However, I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I KNOW Kathi’s book is different.
Oddness, all of this. But I liked it!
B. The week leading up to the death had been filled with important events.
Of course, there'd be no story if Adoulla actually did retire. Instead, the aging ghul hunter receives a desperate message from his unrequited love, Miri Almoussa, who begs him to look into the murder of her niece and her husband, indicating that "it was neither man nor animal that killed them." Though stung by the fact that Miri did not come to make her request of him in person, Adoulla nevertheless agrees to go on one, last adventure for her sake. He and Raseed then set off to investigate this tragedy, in the process meeting the novel's third protagonist, Zamia Badawi, the last of her band and gifted by God with lion-shape. Together, these three characters attempt to solve not only the mystery of the death of Miri's niece but also a greater mystery that threatens the political stability of Dhamsawaat.
The water has bugs, I think.

Breakfast is a manic headlong rush. The lambs are in the stable next to the goats. I have to dash past the lambs into the goats, get Amber up onto the milking platform and milk her into a bucket. I have a jug and three bottles ready, and I milk her in three separate stages because the milk froths on top like a cappuccino and each bottle has to be the same. Besides, it’s how the lambs like it.
(3) As I discussed here, all of the adorable cupcake wrappers that are on the market now are better suited for fondant cupcakes. Often buttercream will leave cupcake wrappers looking greasy and messy.
This graphic novel contains four individual issues of the comic, which is narrated by a goblin called Butterworth. The artwork is fantastic, and really brought the story itself to life. This would be a great book for older children who are looking for something creepy to read, but I also think anyone would enjoy it! I definitely did.
For that, I will be eternally grateful.

The numbers were an afterthought, and I conjure them up for your benefit, only to show you that it was mathematically possible for me to have this tree. When the tree and I were talking, or rather, when that dialogue occurred in my head, it was strictly horticultural. Maybe a bit culinary too. And, yes, I recall a small dose of vanity maybe, just a milligram. During that dialogue, here's what I found out. . .

If needing to communicate effectively with this man beast, it should be done during a commercial break. Let's snag one of these suckers! Bring out the boy bait...
The so-called philosophically oriented physicists of the 20thC, by contrast, are not terribly interesting in terms of our contempoary philosophical tools. Einstein’s ‘Spinozism’ has been talked about by the likes of Dawkins and Hitchens, as a caveat so as not to be interpreted into religious terms. Having an understanding of Spinoza’s metaphysics, by contrast, is not even addressed. Spinoza’s approach to life was one of emotional calm against the overwhelming and sometimes uncontrollable temperaments that we suffer in life. One of the enjoyments that we can have in life is an apprehension of the unity of nature that is, in his metaphysics, how the nature of our inner consciousness subsumed in no small part to the larger reality as a whole, as well as the underlying propositional language that both support. This may sound mystical, but really, it is a form of naturalism. The two prejudices that Spinoza’s philosophy had were: admitting that his metaphysics was fundamentally correct, and we put scientific development and knowledge on a pedestal. None of this is really addressed in the ‘Einsteinian’ view so bastardised by the atheist popularisers.
As I’ve stated before, I never really got into the music of Queen. However, this song has managed to be a part of my childhood. It sounds crazy but I didn’t spend my time watching kid shows when I was around 7, 8, and so on. I was watching shows like Sliders, VR.5, and Highlander. I guess I’ve always been interested in Sci-Fi/action stuff. Today’s song was the theme for the 90′s television show Highlander, starring Adrian Paul. It was also in the 1986 Highlander movie.
The second woman in Alex's life is Ivona, a plain Polish woman whom he met when she simply made up the numbers on an evening out with friends at college. With a 'docile and long-suffering manner' she gives 'the impression of a natural born victim' something that makes Alex feel both sorry for her and hugely irritated by her. But she seems devoted to him, something very different to 'the usual back-and-forth, the game of trying to seduce a woman.'

Like most of us, I first encountered Pete Brown through his books about beer, which are at the same time informative and highly amusing. He has always struck me as someone who would be excellent company for a night in the pub. But recently my admiration for him has further increased due the outspoken stance he has adopted in combating the tide of neo-Prohibitionism.

There’s not a lot of difference between the two examples, but in a short story, where every word counts, precise words are better than place-holding pronouns such as “it.”
In the not-too-distant past when things were good and they talked, John had told her stories, probably myths she now realised, of failed early space missions during which space capsules had failed to achieve orbit, instead carrying on into deep space -potentially for ever- with a payload of frozen, suffocated human remains. These stories apparently originated from radio enthusiasts who claimed to have listened in to the last words of these asphyxiating cosmonauts on the frequencies used by Roscosmos. Ever since, whenever she thought about them, she found it difficult to get the images out of her head: frozen, space-suited corpses, each strapped to seat, drifting through the darkness, slowly diverging. She could see them now.
“Having said all that: the idea that, because of this, there is no difference between the totalitarian state of Qaddafi and the popular uprising against it is bizarre. It also exposes broader political inconsistency.”
Anyway, in order to avoid losing a lot of photos again, or at least increase the odds of having them returned to me, I present to you one more pic that is now locked onto my memory card:
“When it’s safe to go out again, retrieve the largest stones and freeze them as soon as possible to avoid further melting,” Doesken said. “Use a ruler to get an accurate measure of the diameter and a flexible or strong tape or string to measure the circumference. If an accurate scale is available, weigh the stone. Preserve the stone by tightly wrapping and sealing it in an air-tight bag.”
We tested in two modes: Very High, and Ultra High. In Very High, DX11 and HBAO are both enabled, with tessellation set to “Normal” and no AA. Anisotropic filtering is set to x16 in-driver. Ultra High mode turns tessellation up to “High” and adds 8x MSAA. PhysX is off in both cases — while it adds some nice features and effects, it significantly slows down any system without an Nvidia GPU.
There is little chance of recovering any of the money, so Mother is now completely broke. At least she is blissfully unaware.
Am I attempting to change the definition of marriage according to Australian law? Well, yes, obviously that’s what I want – but it’s been done before, more than once, and will be no doubt be done again, either for this reason or some other. So it’s neither ridiculous nor impossible.
The fact that no one had bothered to put in seats for the press also did not go by unnoticed.

This is the first year I've really put effort and consideration into New Years Resolutions (yeah yeah yeah lose weight get healthy blah blah blah). Everything I read, all those worksheets you download and fill out in the hopes that some magical solution would be revealed, all the "what's it all about?" pondering actually revealed something this time: Living in the now is about both forgiveness and patience.

So, you start with 10K of this fake money. And they give you little gifts along the way for dumb stuff like "Hey! Here's 5K for having Pocket Rockets!". So it's pretty easy to get money. And just as easy to lose it.
Here would be an appropriate time to reflect on what the Avengers actually meant to this working class lad from Bramley. I often play my ‘brought up in the seventies in tougher times’ card but its hard sometimes to convey how important comics were to me when I was growing up. The weekly trip to the newsagent was a ritual that contained so much: anticipation, dedication, preoccupation and ultimately imagination. Comics loomed large because they burned bright in my life before girls and punk rock changed it all forever.

To much general rejoicing, Charles Taylor was convicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone in a long-awaited judgment delivered on 26 April 2012. The delays in issuing the judgment are inexcusable. And we are in fact still waiting for the real judgment. Instead, the judges have given us a

I’ve been at the office for a year now. Made some progress, managed to finish my studies and got started on a new project. But finding a job seems to be almost impossible. I keep trying, I keep thinking of ways to move forward but while I had the pain from my kidney I could hardly find any energy to focus on the work to be done. It was all consumed by standing the pain. Anyway life goes on and as long as I’m still alive I have to keep trying to make a life for myself. Many years have passed since I was really happy and felt at ease but I keep thinking that life will take a turn for the better if I keep working on it. Otherwise, I’m fucked.
Did you know I have another blog? Bet you didn't. It isn't open and was started way before this one. This one started on 26/11/2007 and the other one started on 21/2/2007. It inspired Tandleman's Beer Blog, but is really just a personal diary, not about beer. Why am I telling you this? Well here is an extract from a couple of weeks ago:
lost my home in a bad storm
Good thing for me, that me and my family has never been big on Christmas gifts, it was never a tradition for us to exchange gifts, but I did try to at least bake some Christmas goodies to give for friends. Last year, it was extremely last minute, I baked some stuff the night before the last day of work to distribute to some coworkers. Then, I promised myself to plan better next year (which is this year) and bake lots of different goodies, I've already had a list of what I want to make and believe me, there are tons and they're all sounds so good! Now that "next year" is finally here, here I am being in the same situation as last year, if not worse. It's only days before Christmas and here I am typing a small part of this draft post on Sunday at work in between firmware builds, so sad I know.
So I am doing this challenge and the first one is to do animal print nails. I will post the list of the dates and themes at the end of this post. Since I don't really dig animal prints, I decided to do some animals. Birds. But not just any birds. Angry ones. I only did my left hand and I think I will try this mani again sometime in the future and do the pigs on my right hand. We all know how easy it is to do nail art on your dominant hand right?

So last week I felt that my blog really wasn’t up to scratch. This is not a call to let me know how wonderful you thought it was, I simply felt in my heart that It was far from the standard I would have liked it to be. I feel I lost a bit of the purpose of the blog.

It was Jim's intention for the band to be a four piece with bass, drums, two guitars and atleast two leads singers. He naively believed they could be the next Beatles. So the next point of order was to scour a battle of the bands that they were playing and find another guitar player/singer. He found a match in Marty Ross, who was the leader of a Rockford, IL band called The Look. Declaring that The Wigs had much better songs than his current band, Jim suggested Marty come see them play the following week in Kenosha. Marty obliged, and sure enough, the fully formed four-piece Wigs debuted at Marquette University in Milwaukee a week after that.

If I had to use an adjective to describe this book it would be disturbing. When people start getting blind and it is decided that it is a contagious disease they are forced to live in an asylum. This will bring out the best in some and the worst in others. Life becomes a fierce fight for survival. How far are we willing to go when it is our life what is at stake? How much is our life worth when there is no hope? A study of the human nature and its most basic insticts.

Now, I have absolutely no problem with a hard-working family who needs assistance buying groceries for their children for a few months; or, for a family with a severely disabled child where one, or both, parents have to quit their jobs. That’s fine and understandable. They’re the reasons why these program’s were even started.

Of course, we quickly reached the point where my entry into the shop was greeted with much grinning and "Wanting pappadum?" But that hasn't detracted by any means from the fun game of feigning surprise at the feringhi who eats pappad.

I'd like to start this post with an apology to my alarm clock. It took quite the beating this morning, in the still dark hour of SIX AM! I haven't seen that time of day in two weeks, and it was quite the shocker. I enjoyed every second of Winter Break, at home with my kids.

Hanukkah is one small part of Judaism and hoping it can eclipse Christmas is setting one's self up for failure. But if you allow Judaism to have a bigger role in your life all the time, the Christmas season can seem to pale in comparison.
Ok, I’m a retired high school teacher and taught Computer-aided Graphic Design. I just had to “play” with Lightroom since I went to the seminar last Thursday in Los Angeles. I LOVE the clarify slider in Lightroom. Had to combine what I learned in Lightroom and then use my old friend Photoshop to layout.
Perhaps that’s the case here – that someone just doesn’t know any better and wouldn’t know class if it bashed them in the head and gave them a skull fracture and a closed head injury. If so, what do you do about that, other than hope one has advisors around that can discourage such a massive faux pas before it gets out, which obviously isn’t the case here.

Van Damme plays douchebag Chad and asshole Alex. Chad and Alex are the twin sons separated at birth as their parents, who have played an integral role in the construction of the tunnel connecting China and Hong Kong. Their parents are murdered in a plot to gain exclusive control of the revenue from the tunnel, but a nanny rescues Alex and a bodyguard Frank (Geoffrey Lewis) rescues Chad before they are shot as well.

So that’s what? Two from college, and my most recent niece, and then add in two other nieces, and I’ve got five, count ‘em: five! That’s right. I’ve sponsored five young women in their Confirmation. With each one, the task is just as great, and the responsibility weighs just as heavily. One might think I’d be used to it by now, but no. You see, each one of these young women has entrusted to me a sacred duty, to help guide them on their way to heaven. It can make life difficult (for all of us) at times, when the situation warrants me saying something that is not necessarily what anyone wants to hear. But, I’ve had to listen to my own sponsor before when I’ve needed reminders of how I’m supposed to behave, and I’m grateful she is there to help me. With each one, I’m more humbled than before that yet another person has seen in me something I don’t see myself that has caused them to ask me to participate in their lives in a very real way. Humbled is the only word for it (unless you think dumbfounded works; there’s that too).

While I've never categorized books into day books and night books before, there are certainly books I have read far into the night. There are also books that I put down at night because they are too scary to contemplate alone late at night. They might not be traditionally "scary", but they might prompt me to think about uncomfortable things, things I don't want to think about at night, like our insignificance in the universe--stuff like that.

Ms. Amanda has done so many things for me, but all I can do in return is say thank you and try my best at whatever I do. She has taught me the value of recognizing positive qualities in others and encouraging people with words and action. There is a vibrant, ever-flowing energy inside Ms. Amanda that motivates her to work with enthusiasm. She works extremely hard in her office, at school, and at home to help improve the lives of refugee students like me. She works day and night, even sacrificing sleep and rest, to make our futures better, to change the world one PAIR student at a time, and to make history in our lives.

So get this my darlings, as you may know in the past year I have raved about two blow dryers and the outstanding way they perform. So one day while minding my own business I opened my closet of goodies (hair products) and guess who was staring at me? You guessed right, the two dryers that I wrote about. So as usual the hair dryers and I started to conversate (says Beyonce). They were tired of both being in my closet and wanted to come out (every boys dream). So I decided that the only way to freedom was to compete, a heated death match!
- 7 Uruk-hai warriors. I need these for a game on Tuesday. I´m teaching a friend how to play LotR and it´s my comeback to this wonderful game. We´re playing a very basic scenario from a Battlegames in Middle-Earth issue.
A friend of the couple, a Monsieur Husson (Michel Piccoli), is constantly making passes at Séverine. He’s a womanizer by nature, seemingly incapable of anything else, and his aggressive come ons seem to some degree to be more courtesy extended to her than genuine attempts for her affections. He too seems convinced that Séverine is unassailable in her chastity, giving his illicit courtship a tragi-comedic air of futility. Unfortunately, all it does is frustrate Séverine, who seems as though she only wishes she could indulge in the kinds of casual dalliances Husson takes for granted. In fact, it’s through him that she learns of Parisian brothels, high class places where society housewives go to spend afternoons making extra money in the arms of men who are more interesting than their husbands. It’s meant for something to shock and get a laugh, something inconceivable for the social strata she lives in: a silly thing other, less savory people do. But it’s enough to get Séverine to pry an address out of Husson, and show up at the doorstep of the brothel.
I checked my camera and shifted outside, then a few feet up to the side of the house. I crept to the same front window and peeked inside. The smell of cigars and booze preceded the picture inside. Heavy smoke filled the air. About eight men of various sizes laughed and played what looked like poker. Principal Sal, the literal definition of “the elephant in the room”, was in the midst of it all.

Two days later he tells his disciples that he’s heading to Bethany. The disciples remind him about the Pharisees in Jerusalem who hate him and tried to stone him to death, and that Bethany is right by Jerusalem. Jesus answers that a person who walks in daylight will not stumble, and it’s only if they try to walk at night that they fall because there’s no light to see by. Jesus walks by the Father’s light, so everything will be just fine. Jesus tells them that Lazarus has “fallen asleep” and that he needs to be “woken up”. Jesus is referring to the sleep of death, but the disciples think he means actual sleep, and say that maybe getting some extra sleep will be healthy for him. Jesus lets their misunderstanding pass, for now; he says only that he’s glad he wasn’t there when it happened, that way the disciples will believe in the power of God when they do get there. The disciples are convinced that Jesus will be killed if he goes back near Jerusalem, but the apostle Thomas tells the other disciples that they should go with Jesus anyway, so that they can die with him.
For these current essays, the best practice may be another kind of flipped classroom.

While I had a moment today, I read an article in the latest Mary Jane’s Farm magazine, about a couple who have built a whole business around the idea of gratitude. It struck me, because of the content of the article, but also because I had just read another article about changing your attitude from one of questioning to one of recognizing things to be thankful for. I love this idea, by the way – the notion that we, ALL of us, have things to be thankful for, if only we take the time to recognize and identify them. Not that everyone’s life is just peachy every moment of every day, of course. It’s just that, in the midst of even the worst tragedy or the most difficult times, there are small comforts, or people who care for us, or even just beautiful sunsets that we can appreciate and for which we can give thanks.

Monkeyphonic Alpahabets. Don't get me started on this one! This started life trying to be a funk/rock song because I was heavily influenced at the time by Little Barrie who are heavy rockin' but oh so funky with it, but nobody wanted to touch it. So I re wrote it as a jazzy vibe, all nice and mellow. Again, nobody would play it. I was really getting frustrated by this time because I knew that I had something good going down but I wasn't sure how to breath life into it. I stuck with it and one day, quite out of the blue, I was noodling away on the tune that we always warmed up to, which was a bastardisation of an old David Crosby vibe that he had nicked off Neil Young, and bugger me if the lyrics didn't fit it exactly! The chorus just wanted a new set of chords and it was job done. Everybody liked it. We then recorded it with a ten minute version with about 100 guitars all over it! The idea was to use a fade out technique but we later decided against this. Nobody fancied editing it either, so I spent a four hour session one evening with Ian at Airplay just trimming, trimming, trimming until we had got it down to what I regarded as an acceptable 7.30 secs bang on and most of the mess cleaned up. It still required a considerable amount of work after that to tidy up and make good, but the end result is a song that the majority of people say is their favorite Magic Ship song, including a lot of chicks. Yeah baby! If I had a penny for everybody who has said that they have no idea what it is about then I'd be quite rich by now. All I'll say is that after sending some lyrics to a mate of mine, very early on in my first flush of writing songs, he said that I was full of Transatlanticisms and general nonsense verbosity by using words such as 'baby' and so forth. Serves me right for asking for an opinion! So I set about writing a song about such verbosity and nonsense. I was reminded by a particular episode of South Park where Cartman is given a Monkey Phonics play set to help him improve his literacy and I kind of connected with the idea of using the Monkey Phonics concept to express my feeling at being regarded as nothing much more than a verbose lyricist. And this was feed back from a bloke that writes songs about homosexual prostitutes! However, it's not just about verbosity. That was just my songwriters gimmick. The song eventually became all about...

Here’s one I did recently, which I yearned for on my bucket list and finally got to do, but not even by my own doing. I was lucky enough to go on a dinner cruise down the River Thames. Why was this on my bucket list? Because it was a yearning, a materialistic want and a feeling I never thought I’d experience.
Fry, as a student of anthropology, has clearly forgotten one of the basic tenets of human sexuality, that men are here to screw as much as they can, and women to have babies, but of course, within that, there are a billion shades of sexuality - women who bloody love it, men who (literally) shrink away, and the same applies if you're gay. If you and your partner(s) can live with it, it's all acceptable. Methinks Mr Fry feels a little uncomfortable with sex, which isn't uncommon - I was told about a bloke who didn't like kissing during The Act, which I thought was a bit odd - but I wish Fry wouldn't use his own awkwardness to make women feel terrible.

If, as the gay community have embraced the word “queer”, and black rap stars have embraced the words once used to oppress them, I must embrace a word so long used to deride and intimidate me and mine, then so be it, is it not better to embrace a word than it is to be ruled by one?

Example, think library late fees. Nobody takes these seriously because, well, worst case scenario, you pay 15 cents. By the way, the one of the biggest jerk move is when someone pays their library late fee with a $20 bill. The librarian has to open up the empty cash register, sigh, and confess they can’t make change therefore cancelling the 10 cent fee.

What do I supposed to expect when you guys come back “Home” to the series against the New York Mets? Are you going to forget to pitch with location? Are you going to miss the West Coast and stop hitting home runs for many games down the road because your mom, aunt or cousin is not looking from the stands? Is that what is going on with Heath Bell? Is he missing his family so bad that he has created a complete chaos all over the team? Remember we had to bring players from the minors and send players back to accommodate forBell’s mishaps? Remember Cishek having to come to the rescue and playing and performing like a gold glove veteran? Thank God for that by the way.

My boyfriend is hot, I'm starting to get my shit together, learning more about love and life and how not to be a confused, selfish bitch, and meeting new people.

There are three ways to initiate a PGR proceeding. They are often referred to as “windows” (first window and second window) in which a third party petitions the Director of the USPTO to initiate a PGR proceeding. These windows differ procedurally and substantively, as described below. The third means of initiating a PGR proceeding is based on the patentee’s consent.

I wanted to also share a wonderful blessing our family has received this season. My father who was diagnosed with lung cancer 3 years ago was told he only had a year to live. He had suffered through chemo several times and then a few months ago developed shingles. He grew weaker and weaker each year. Recently his doctors discovered he was able to start taking a new drug. A drug that some are calling the miracle pill. Two months ago his tumors were 4cm and growing. This week we learned that they are now only 1cm!!!!!!!
Several of the artists were drawn to the issue of race.

When I arrived in Cookeville, TN, an 18-year-old college freshman with no friends in a town far from home, I didn’t know a whole lot. I was not a student of God’s Word, and rarely contemplated matters of faith. I had no more than a vague idea about what I would do with my life. All I knew was that I loved music, and church seemed like a good place to meet friends.

There are several factors. According to Fr. Frank Pavone of Priests for Life, pregnancy is a biorhythm (this is not New Age junk science.) Sleep is also a biorhythm. If you wake up in the middle of the night your body tells you to go back to sleep. Similarly many women who abort (an interruption to the biological process of pregnancy) feel the urge to get pregnant again.

Yesterday my super crafty friend Amanda & I took an impromptu mini-road trip to check out the Picket Fence Gals vintage sale in Lindstrom, MN. Lindstrom is the most adorable little Scandinavian town, with a tea kettle water tower and the yummiest little main-street bakery. Right along the main drag, you'll find the Picket Fence Gals are nestled in a big, white, old, and adorable Victorian house. Once a month (Wed-Sun), twenty-something awesome antique vendors pool their goodies and open their doors for a giant sale of vintage items. They are constantly updating their displays and the treasures are all new every month!

We're heading back to my doc again this morning. I just don't get how I can be on day 4 of a Z-pack and not be improved. The obvious answer is that it's not the right med for the job. So we'll see... I'm losing my patience, though.
So work's been a real killer for me, and I'm finally able to update the blog because I have a day off! But besides that, I'm prepping up for school which starts August 15th for me, the brewing, and my third anniversary to my lovely wife. (It's the leather anniversary!)
The beer was so popular, that the boss offered to buy the ingredients next year. So next year I'll brew a Christmas beer for me, and one for the office.
Me: Well it's our anniversary, not Valentine's Day. And we only get one every 4 years.

2011 VW Passat does not sell in the U.S. In designing the 2012 model, it was concluded that the European-sized Passat 2008-2010 generation is too small to midsize car to compete as a true American. So enlarge the all-new 2012 model by more than three inches in wheelbase and overall length, creating the most prominent class-dimensional measurements in each. Cabin comfort is very good. Especially noteworthy is the car’s rear seat accommodation a shame that larger and more expensive lots.Previous Passats offered sedan and wagon body styles, but the 2012 model comes only as a sedan.

Fantasy Update. I really need to listen to my own words. I said Kasey Khane and Dale Jr. were some dark horses that would do well. Did I put them on my team? Of course not. Although I did have Kyle Busch on my team, he didn’t lead enough laps to surpass Carl Edwards (not on my team). I am solidly in 9th place for the first segment. No way to recover. I just hope I don’t continue to fall. I did very well at Daytona so maybe I can recoup some dignity at Talladega.
As mentioned in the last Post for Savatage – Dead Winter Dead, the band, under the guidance of producer Paul O’Neill morphed into Trans-Siberian Orchestra. I say morphed because they didn’t change their name, Savatage released other albums later on, and TSO was not only Savatage although they remain the entities key players:
Mr. Paul was able to stand on his feet, to my surprise, and he told me that one of his friends had recommended that he start walking more instead of using his wheelchair so much, so that his legs could get strong enough for him to not need his wheelchair; and he said that he had practiced walking with his cane or walker usually, and so that is why he was able to stand now, he said that his friend’s advice was working.

My weekend just got luckier as my best friend went into labor Saturday night and had her precious little boy Sunday afternoon. I was still in town to be able to go and visit.

“Girls” is, in other words, a particularly galling example of tokenism, in which the only unsung voices we’re allowed to hear are the ones that fit the other prejudices of the people operating the sound system. Just as it’s not progress in representations of people of color if the only ones we see are drug dealers or welfare moms, it’s not progress in representations of women if the only ones we see aren’t all that different from the Carrie Bradshaws to whom we’ve already been overexposed. By all means, if people find this show interesting and entertaining, they should watch. But they shouldn’t be telling the world that it’s some sort of feminist triumph when there’s so, so much else that’s wrong with it.

We are indeed disturbed by your letter. We knew that Mrs. Wilder had not meant to imply that Indians were not people and we did not want to distress her if we could possibly avoid it. I must admit to you that no one here realized that those words read as they did. Reading them now it seems unbelievable to me that you are the only person who has picked them up and written to us about them in the twenty years since the book was published. We were particularly disturbed because all of us here feel just as strongly as you apparently feel about such subjects, and we are proud that many of the books on the Harper list prove that. Perhaps it is a hopeful sign that though such a statement could have passed unquestioned twenty years ago it would never have appeared in anything published in recent years.

For each block, you'll need a strip that is 40-ish inches long (or two 20-ish inches, if you're using FQs). It should be no narrower than 1 inch and no wider than 2.5 inches.
Excuse me, but how does that make it anti-Semitic again? It is not denying the fact that Hamas carries our terrorist activities and it condemns those activities. Just because it doesn’t do as the E.U and the U.S.A does, that is shutting its ears and saying “lalalalala” like an insolent child, doesn’t make it wrong. It makes it pragmatic.
The courtroom was large, and beautifully elegant, and everything started on time. After the formalities that took place as the judge entered, the rest of the ceremony was touching, sometimes a little emotional and often delightful. As they called out the names of the 71 new citizens-to-be, each of us stood up and named our country of origin. I was amazed that in a corner of the mid-west that is not usually known for its diversity, the courtroom now housed people from an incredible array of countries. My husband quickly wrote down most of the names of the countries on the back of an envelope holding our citizenship packet. You can see them in the Wordle image at the top of this post – the larger names represent multiple people from the same country. We did miss a few countries we couldn’t hear clearly enough, but, this was a memorable and touching part of a ceremony that accorded tremendous respect to the backgrounds of the people in the room.

It surprises me sometimes that reminents of my eating disorder are left over. I think that I am so used to living with them that they often go unnoticed. Lately, though I have been trying to be aware of them. These leads me back to my first post on triggers which was several weeks ago. In it I showed what went through my mind when I was ‘triggered’. In this post I want to show what I do (or should do) when I am triggered. So now in response to “The Inner Dialogue of Triggers” I am going to introduce you to the “Inner Response to Triggers”.

This all started back in June, when I was watching and admiring the creativity and artistry in some of my favorite music videos. After viewing them quite a bit, I realized that a few of these unique videos were actually not quite videos– but rather– composed of hundreds of pictures put together very quickly to the songs. Of course, after this discovery, I had to give it a try.
I ask for a month opt out. ( December) They say yes. They take the money in December anyway and then try to take the next due payments 10 days after that. I phone up to point out we cannot pay 4 fuel payments in less then a fortnight and they agreed to change the direct debit date to the end of January ( only they don't). I phone again when I realise by looking online they haven't and they advise me to cancel the direct debit as they have requested the money and it's too late to stop it, so I do. They take the money from the credit on the account anyway. Only £50 more on both. Why? The computer did it apparently. They had no other answer or any solution. It's is like going in my purse as it was our money. So we have still ending up paying more than 4 lots in a fortnight and the direct debit is still going out on the same day. Moral to this is don't take an opt out even if they say you can. Unbelievable.
Sometimes, I'm obsessive compulsive to the point that even I get sick of myself, literally. I usually try variations on a single recipe and different recipes relating to the same thing for days on end until I satisfy myself that the recipe is the one I want as my "to go to" recipe, or the one recipe I'm willing to replicate to eat for the immediate future.
Of course fate decreed that I didn’t need them. The nearest person to me as I arrived on the beach was Barry; a nice man and a great subject.

Don’t get me wrong. . .my husband is genuinely a gorgeous man at 6’2, 248 pounds of pure vocational muscle, and he knows this. At times Julian can be conceited, but I figured his conceitedness derives from the mere fact of being self-employed and having to compete against other Arborists, so a bit of cockiness was in order.

Today, we as a human race have accomplished that now most people live in big cities. This also means that most people are in it for themselves, just trying to pay off their rent. Most likely when it comes to survival they also are in it for themselves. So I think that all people need to follow a set of rules during apocalyptic survival:
He won for the fifth consecutive year, in 6.59sec, to boost his confidence before another busy winter and spring, including a race in Karlsruhe, Germany, today. This time, however, the final destination is different. Instead of aiming for the big championships of the winter – which this year is the world indoor championships in Moscow – Gardener’s sights are set on the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne in March, where he will be hoping to at last win an individual medal in a major 100m. It is the quality of the field in Melbourne, where six of the world’s top 10, including world record holder Asafa Powell, from Jamaica, are eligible to compete, that has persuaded Gardener that he cannot afford to take the risk of doing the two events, which are only five days apart.

Happy Sunday stampers! It is time for another challenge from Stampin' Sisters in Christ. This week's hostess is the blog founder Kris, who selected this verse Colossians 1:27b "...Christ in you, the hope of glory". Her challenge for this week is to use something transparent, acetate, vellum, etc., somewhere on your card. And our sponsor this week is Serendipity, the source of the toadstool and leaves image in my card. Such detailed, lovely stamps, you can find the company web site right here. I had lots of fun coloring this image.

He tells Lilly to take him to his hotel. On the ride he mentions Troubadour, the horse that paid 70/1, and asks her how much she got paid to let that happen. She tries to claim she was down on the horse but there was too much action and he asks "Do you want to stick to that story or do you want to keep your teeth?"
The great thing about this movie is the personal dilemmas the characters face. Each one is emotionally distraught in the present and can’t fix it using conventional means. They’re completely believable and well thought-out. The downfalls of this movie are probably felt only by someone like me, who loves the 80s. There weren’t enough references to the present time and most jokes were about the past in relation to the present (like what they can invent using their knowledge) instead of being confused as to what was available at the time and what wasn’t. That part of unavailability was represented probably by the nephew character, but he didn’t seem to get enough screen time.

All these photos of the churchyard were taken by me on Wednesday in Poulton le fylde, On a rainy spring day. Usually the flowering is much more profuse, it is a little sparce this year. People travel here every year to take photos, it is such a gorgeous display (photos not doing justice) and they buy postcards which are for sale in St. Chads church (where my Mum's funeral was, and where I was married to my first husband in 1978!)
I don't feel like I can be truly honest about what I'm feeling like and that's hard. I've put a lot of effort into growing this blog and it isn't as private as it used to be. People I know in real life read what I write - although some deny it strongly which I will never understand - and that means I have to censor much of what I discuss here.

I was a little tongue tied in Quebec City, where I again met up with a crowd of people I hadn't seen in almost 10 years. I was nervous at seeing them all, given how much I had changed physically. Gone was the trendy hairdo, the svelteness of my youth. But, after a few minutes of hiding behind some well-placed legs and I began to find my own voice. It didn't matter how much I had changed on the outside; I was still the same on the inside and that was what mattered.
I finished the dishtowel off with an aqua crochet border, I think it finishes it off nicely.
When I'm going to stamp directly onto the base of a card, I stamp the image onto a scrap piece of the same card to test how it stamps.
I have noticed recently that many online airfare reservation companies are advertising a price match guarantee. Meaning that within a certain period of time, if you find anything cheaper, they will refund you the difference. Some important things to realize here is that you will need to track the prices after you buy the ticket and see if there are any other comparable fares that pop up during the window of opportunity. Most companies offering this guarantee are banking on the fact that their customers are going to forget to follow up.

In the European elections, Spain is a single constituency and our plan is of course to submit an application. We have two years until June 2014 to work and see the possibilities we have in order to place one of our representatives in the Parliament in Strasbourg. We know that we will have a major support from European identitarian parties. That very year, in autumn 2014 provided no advancement is done, Plataforma per Catalunya will run in the Catalan elections with great chances to enter Parliament, and a few months later, in the spring of 2015, Platform will present hundreds of candidatures for the municipal elections in Catalonia and in the rest of Spain.

I read a lot of Jacqueline Wilson to my partner’s daughter which she thoroughly enjoyed. But I also read her the beginning of Great Expectations and I saw her eyes grow wide. She was totally hooked. With young children so much depends on the adult and whether they transfer their love of story and whether they can bring stories to life.

"It's a shame we haven't got two beardy blokes in the back," her mother said, "we'd be our own little Abba tribute band!" The girl couldn't sing for laughing as her mother was purposefully failing to hit the notes. The singing reached quite a volume as the car pulled up at a red light, passersby either tutted or smiled depending on what sort of day they'd had. They pulled away again as the light turned green. The girl sensed the kid's presence one second before she saw him. He'd walked out without looking, fortunately her mother managed to brake sharply.

I stole something…in a round about way. Kinda. Well, no I did. I must confess. As some of you are aware I was up half the night with anxiety over a missing teaspoon. When things go missing I go crazy. I thought it was just dummies but lately things are getting out of hand. Nothing should “just go missing” in my house. Everything is in order, so when something breaks that order I get proper anxious about it.

Mosimane has failed to get Orlando Pirates, Mamelodi Sundowns and Golden Arrows players recently for the 0-0 South Africa draw with Equatorial Guinea fielding five uncapped players in the starting line-up and handing three more rookies their maiden caps in the second half. That drama continued forcing the coach to call five more players to replace those called by their clubs.

Yet another of the multitude of things I really looked forward to on my trip to the UK was a chance to see some real suits of armor up close (stop rolling your eyes my English friends). We just don't have that sort of thing in the part of America where I live, other than replicas at Renaissance themed restaurants, so I was really excited to visit the Royal Armories at the Tower of London.

First off, let me say that present tense is not a reason I categorically reject a novel submission. But it often becomes a contributing reason, because successful present tense novel writing is much, much more difficult to execute than past tense novel writing. Most writers, no matter how good they are, are not quite up to the task.
The Clue of the Broken Locket---this is my all-time favorite title. I probably read it twenty times. As is evidenced by the way the first dozen pages have disengaged from the spine, this one is in definite need of being repaired.

Setting out along the walls of York, the ancient Minster loomed in the distance and made for some incredible photos; though beautiful to look upon, the cathedral felt even more breathtaking when the bells tolled. For those who saw the cathedral built 1,000 years ago, it would be just as majestic as it is today.

I have a ton of great stuff to add from the past few months I have just been extremely busy. I have a few beers from the Bahamas, there are some great ones down there to go with Conch. Quite a few new ones from here in Utah, and I also had to make a trip to Wyoming and tried some stuff from Wind River that was quite good as well, and that is a little closer than Freeport or Nassau to go on a beer run.
Next was Brenda with her first - and I suspect not the last - use of a LOTV image, here. Gorgeous colouring and a perfect mix of green, pink and purple - those colours all go together brilliantly. Brenda had a bit of a sad face as she hadn't put her sentiment on the front of the card - I think it would have had as much, if not more, impact anyhow on the inside where it ended up :) It's often good to open up a card and then see the link between the sentiment and the front of the card. Do go to see the beautiful result! Then Brenda returned later in the week with this beauty. It's a Christmas card, yup we're already making those, and the red and blues that Brenda used go so well together. Do hop over to see - I've just been for another look and not many of you have called by, you're missing a super card!

I do add a couple drops of essential oil (Rainforest blend) to make it smell better but I still find I need a bit of styling product to scrunch my curls. On days I don't scrunch, but just blowdry - it's amazing. I just don't like the vinegar smell.

Do we always need to have a team spirit in the workplace? What does it actually mean? A culture that once valued experience, honesty, diligence, reliability and maturity has been replaced, in some workplaces at least, with one that rewards conformity, youth, extroversion, enthusiasm and energy. We need a balance between the two and a recognition that a bad team player might nevertheless be a valued employee.

Then it was only a matter of time until I purchased some cotton, reusuable pads. Lunapads. So much more comfortable than paper pads, let me tell you! However, rather expensive and I was loathe to buy more than the starter pack because, really, I could make some of my own. I mean, I had seen all the cool ones that Soulemama had made. But I didn't for another year or so. Mom eventually make me a whole bunch more when she came with me to New Denver. And now I have a huge stash that I never use all of when I am 'on the rag', so to speak. On the light days of my period, the diva cup is enough. But on the heavier days, there is a bit of leakage and for this, the cloth pads are wonderful. I used a thrifted flannel sheet, as well as some I had saved or Rhiannon's which were like new because she almost never slept in her own bed.... and a thrifted towel for the inside part when I made my own. When one of the pads is dirty, I just pop it into an ice cream bucket that sits on top of my dryer (which is a stacked one, so it is way up high, out of everyone's sight). The bucket has water and oxyclean in it. When my period is over, I rinse out the water and throw them in the wash. They come out perfectly clean with no stains.
To some degree, critics are correct when they say that she is under scrutiny like no candidate in a long, long time. But they are incorrect when they suggest sexism. If this was a good-looking and rugged candidate named Sam Palin acting and saying the exact same things, the scrutiny would be also be the same. (To that end, if she was plain-looking, male or female, nothing would change.) It has nothing to do with her gender or appearance, although those become convenient excuses. This country has become collectively tired and even angry at the social conservatives driving every agenda in this country. Even many Republicans are finally understanding that part of the reason that the party has left its fiscally responsible roots is because fiscal policy no longer drives the GOP: it’s repealing Roe v. Wade; it’s electing “conservative” judges (also strictly a Roe v. Wade issue); it’s “good Christian values”; it’s cleaning up the airwaves; it’s protecting marriage from gays.

When we speak of “signatures of the heart,” we speak of those vibrations that you know of already that seem to arise mysteriously from the realms of the heart and spine, the kundalini energy. While feeling deeply, the vibration goes out to your entire body and then into the “field of energy” surrounding the physical form.
The old saying, “reduce, reuse, recycle,” very much still applies. With the emphasis in that order. Cut down on bringing new stuff into our lives. Then what we can, reuse it as much as possible, and when tossing stuff, recycle. And in the latter case, recycle responsibly, bring electronics and hazardous materials to recycling stations where they will be handled responsibly.

Today’s prayer: Lord, only You can form a conscience in an instant. It will take me a lifetime to help shape the consciences of Your blessings so that they choose to regret unkind actions, instead of just being upset by the consequences of their actions. Please grant me patience and the abundant grace I will need to set a good example for them at all times. Thank You for their willingness to forgive, and their nascent understanding that You rejoice whenever one of Your children turns from self-serving thoughts and deeds in a spirit of loving repentance. You forgive us freely, without holding our transgressions over our heads or carrying grudges, and we would follow You. Please teach us to speak, think, and act with the mercy we would have shown to us.

Other Person: That's impossible! What if they want to go to the moon in a spaceship? I can't get my kids what they want every time they ask! I'd be broke. Here's why I have a problem with this kind of thinking: It's focused on the impossibilities, the exceptions, the singularities. It's focused on what we can't do. How often do our children want things that are truly impossible to get? More importantly, how often do our children want things that are possible, and we brush them off because we have to teach them they can't always get what they want.

I should point out there's no great plan at work here (which won't come as much of a surprise to regular readers, I'm sure): serendipitously I just happened to end up with or read a bunch of books that fall into the spy fiction category, so Espionage Week it is – or Spy Week, or Spooks Week, or Secret Service Week, or whatever you wanna call it. Hopefully, barring disaster or a sudden systemic failure of enthusiasm, there'll be posts on John le Carre, Ian Fleming, and one other author who shall remain nameless for the moment, but who'll be of particular interest to Book Glutton.

Then my son came along. Again, Mum literally cried when I told her I wasn’t christening him. Mum told me if I didn’t get him christened, she was going to take him to church while she was babysitting him (she looked after him while I worked) and have it done. She was NOT risking her grandson going to hell because his mother was a heathen. So, after discussion with my husband, and a lot of thought, I decided to get the deed done, but, on MY terms. My Mum was born in Russia, so, as a child I went to Russian School, which was attached to the Russian Orthodox Church. During the Saturday School, we had four ‘classes’. Two of language, one of history and one of religion. For the last three years I was at the school, the priest was our religion teacher, but, he knew I was an atheist (one of the VERY few people I ‘came out’ to at the time). So, during the ‘religion’ classes, we did interesting things. We discussed all sorts of social, societal and philosophical questions. I remember we did a whole term on “subliminal suggestion in advertising”, where we discussed it, got ads and tried to find the subliminal messages in them, including finding little skulls in ice cubes in vodka ads, etc. But I digress. This priest knew I was an atheist. He’d allowed me to be ‘godmother’ to my beautiful god-daughter knowing I was an atheist (I will go into this more in another post, soon). So, I thought, I’ll ring him and discuss this whole child-christening thing with him.
4. Drive the kids to school in your pajamas. Don't worry about anyone seeing you. If they do, they'll probably be jealous they didn't think of it first. You can shower and get dressed later. After your own bowl of cereal and a couple more cups of coffee.

If you had the chance of cooking anything for Michel Roux Jr, would you choose cheap and unlovely to look at but apparently delicious Coley, or would you pick Halibut – the king of the seas with the price tag to match? Well, you might have noticed that Masterchef contestants rarely go for the cheap cuts and (with the exception of a few episodes where they drifted down to Borough Market to sniff cheese) there’s very little focus on sourcing ingredients…this makes me worry about the profitability of the restaurants they’re going to open when they’ve won.
“That’s a silly attitude!” he tells her.
Weight: Still 201 :( No change, but haven’t gained anything either, so that’s good.
It was a quaint little 'stalls only' theatre that ran 'second-run' films. I learned how to clean the projection room, which was no easy chore, polishing floors and brass, dusting everywhere. It was like being in the army. I worked twelve hours a day five days a week. The lavatory had an opening at the bottom of the door and my initiation ceremony was to be locked in and be exposed for a short time to the smoking burning fumes of nitrate film wrapped in burning newspaper! As it turned out, the Century was an ideal training ground and amongst the interesting experiences was to see a fellow projectionist partially mangle his finger in the intermittent sprocket, during the screening of the Norman Wisdom Comedy "A Stitch In Time", in an attempt to avoid stopping the film when the film ripped on the projector. The only time I saw this film in colour was when the film was being repaired on the rewind bench stained with his blood! During my time at the Century Cinema I had an offer to work at the Odeon in Southend, but felt I wasn't ready. In September 1964 I finally accepted and, looking back, spent the two happiest years of my working life there.
So far I've sent out eight. I've got two partials out and I've gotten four rejections. I know that's not much yet, and I know I don't have any choice but to keep trying or give up. The trick now is to figure out how eldest does it. How she cries bitter tears (I reserve the right to eat chocolate instead) then shakes it off and keeps going, her spirit undiminished. It's probably mostly up to the fact that she's seven.
These flowers I absolutely love, I have had them for a while. I won them years ago at a crop but they had all been taken out of the original packaging and put into a decorated bag so I'm not sure who makes these or if they're still being made. They're a very thin plastic. If anyone knows could you please let me know..I would love to buy more.
Alas, the 2 hours of beer drinking came to an end at 8 and the brilliant plan of eating hamburgers at Casino El Camino was hatched. An hour wait did not dissuade us from the need for delectable cow between bread. We happily grabbed some beers and met interesting folks also priming themselves for SXSW. The place was packed, and the wait was worth it.
As I watched the angels worship God this day I caught for a brief moment a beautiful glimpse into an eternity that I did not want to end.

Jack is gone to visit family in Texas this weekend so I have the homestead to myself. Feels funny to be here alone now. I couldn't help but to feel my isolation last night as I went downstairs to check the fire. The full moon illuminated the black forest around me and in the not so far distance the coyotes were singing their awful, joyful hunting song. I shivered. I stoked the fire and ran back inside to snuggle in the bed alone. Things will be better in the morning.
There should be no problem with adventures, frontiers, player autonomy, or even placing dungeons in the early modern age; the big change you notice is they need to be more remote or isolated. XP for gold might seem a bit fishy - in an age with nation states, would private individuals amass vast fortunes through sacking old ruins? I just have to stop and remember Spanish galleons loaded with treasure, and I can see the XP for gold mechanic still working out in early modern.

When my children were small, I felt like I knew what I was doing as a mother. Like my Sister in Africa, I wore my babies in a sling on my hip or my back. I nursed them into toddler-hood. It felt natural, like they would be tethered to me forever.
Some may say that such a film is terrible, for it destroys human subjectivity, reducing people to mere placeholders for emotions and thoughts and words which transect them. And yet, what if such a film is also exploring the potential for new forms of subjectivity? Might we simply be fearing change? Might there not be a way to make a film like Noriko’s Dinner Table, not themed around horror, but rather, around love?

Owls belonging to genus Asio are known as the eared owls, as they have tufts of feathers resembling mammalian ears. These “ear” tufts may or may not be visible. Asio flammeus will display its tufts when in a defensive pose. However, its very short tufts are usually not visible.

But over the last three years, the tide has turned. We broke the Taliban’s momentum. We’ve built strong Afghan Security Forces. We devastated al Qaeda’s leadership, taking out over 20 of their top 30 leaders. And one year ago, from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. The goal that I set – to defeat al Qaeda, and deny it a chance to rebuild – is within reach.
Driving on to Water Canyon, we were a little surprised not to see any of the hawks or meadowlarks that we’d seen there just a few weeks earlier, but did definitively identify a couple of Chihuahuan Ravens, seeing for the first time their usually hidden white throat patch. I do regret not getting that picture or one of the amazing sight of a small herd of pronghorn chasing a coyote, but sometimes that’s just the way it goes.

The trip itself at near on 4 hours each way is quite long, and be prepared for speed. These ferries are a cross between a small liner and a powerboat! If the sea is a little choppy, you can expect some rough and tumble: the whup-whup-whup-whup- as the bow hits the waves you feel with your guts more than hear with your ears - But that's part of the fun...

And speaking of chicks, I want to share some new additions to the living room. I recently won a giveway from Lydia at Pudel Design. Lydia was so sweet to open her giveaway worldwide, even though she lives in Germany. And I was thrilled to win, because I really loved what she was giving away. Lydia is a talented artist, and she was giving away a series of 3 chick paintings that she created. She also was giving away a fun insect pillow! I have added everything to the living room. For now the paintings are on the mantle (well two of them as I could only fit two, but I think I am going to hang them on the wall. Here they are for now....
And so it goes on. There are monthly variations, too. Twice a month, around the full moon and new moon, we get what is called a spring tide. This is when the high tide is at its highest and the low is at its lowest.
At the moment, I'm reading Janny Wurts' 'The Wars of Light and Shadow' series. These are fabulous, amazing books, by a writer of staggering gifts, and I love them to bits. By a clear margin, the best fantasy epics I've ever read; rich in detail at every level, powerful, moving, inspiring and brilliant.
i know that sounds like a lot of explanation, but i wanted to drive that home, because it might seem like it makes more sense to choose the image that you want to appear first in your animation as you base image, and then go in that order from there. but if you do that, your animation will play in a backwards order. and it might seem counterintuitive for your earlier animation frames to have higher layer numbers. but if you start renaming all the layers, it can get confusing, especially if you have several. you could also move layers around... but again, it could get rather messy if you do that. i'm trying to limit the steps and keep it as simple as possible. so i think it's best to just let Photoshop number them as you add them and leave them as is.

I love shopping second hand, everything is a special treasure to me and I spent a fraction of what I could if I purchaed retail. I love the character of things that have been loved on through the years.
As we walked back towards the agricultural shed where we store our machinery, I mentioned to Gérard that all that remained to be tidied up was the field nearest the shed. I verbally patted him on the back and waxed lyrical on the great progress we have made over the years clearing up such a neglected property. I basked in my reminiscences and recollections, reminding him of how our farm once looked. As we moved closer towards the shed he became quieter, almost sheepish. I still, naive woman that I am, hadn't put two and two together....Can you guess? Are you more in tune with 'French farmer logic' than me?

Another noticeable omission – like the HDMI connection – is the rear-facing camera. Presumably in order to save costs, Acer dispensed with this feature that, although standard on virtually all tablets, isn’t necessarily essential. How many times do you take your tablet out to take some pictures?

First, notice that the variable we added is “dateCreated”. This is important, because that is a magic field name that tells grails that it should automatically populate it with the current date/time when the record is created. That way, we aren’t responsible for writing any code to populate this field, when the author clicks “Post” it will automatically happen.

On our very last day we were there, miracle of miracles, we saw a tiny spot of blue sky peeking through the clouds. We all ran outside to witness the sky. By mid-morning the sky was completely blue and the sun was shining. We decided to stay an extra day and made a mad dash for the beach. Me and Phil went earlier in the day (without baby) and later in the afternoon took Audrey for her first experience with the ocean.
And over all that, this insistent pounding presence saying spend spend spend, look, flashy lights, spend, it will make you happy if you spend, you might win, you've lost much you need to spend more to get yourself out of the hole, spend spend spend.
A week ago I went into the nursing home to see her, having known her time would soon be ending. I wore a sweatshirt, one with wings on it, (for all of those musically knowledgeable people, or anyone who sees me often enough, it was my blue Hopesfall hoodie, the one with the wings from “No Wings To Speak Of” on it.) Though she could hardly form sentences, or even keep her eyes open, one of the maybe three things she said to me was how much she loved my sweatshirt. She said those wings, “they give me hope.”
Shu Uemura Lash Curler: All you need to do is read the reviews for this. It is almost everyone's favourite. It creates soft and natural curves to the lashes -- but not crimped. It's pricey, but it's not something you need to repurchase often, so it's worth it.

Then, given the very obvious gullibility of our loathsome media - these so clever, so sophisticated people - what can you trust from them? What can you trust from people who are telling us things as fact which, less than 24 hours later, are admitted to be false? And we are not referring to events in some far-flung corner of the earth, but in Washington. And how much more BS are clever, sophisticated people going to take before they wake up and realise that they are being fed BS ... and then start growing up?
Now if you have a blow torch, you don't have anything to worry about. But for people like me who don't own one, the oven comes in handy, and fetches the same result as a blow torch. I must admit, however, that the first time I tried it, I managed to literally burn the cream. I turned around for a couple of seconds to clear my kitchen counter and there I could already smell the burnt caramel and it was torturous trying to get it off my pretty ramekins. The second time I watched it like a hawk and came up with beautiful, even caramel topping. So here I shall explain in detail how to go about the process (since I'm kinda jobless right now) :)

Because, unlike Mr. Liptak, I’m not getting paid for looking for dirty words in judicial decisions, I am unable, for now at least, to push my inquiry any further. But for those interested in the subject, there is an article by Christopher M.

Men can choose to wear collared t shirts, khaki shorts and strappy sandals or topsiders. They can wear plain shirts with solid colours such as blue, green, black or grey. V-neck t shirts and crew neck shirts are popular choices. The rule of the thumb is the more comfortable they are, the better.

Charumbira became sick and died. After his death all the vaShawasha were called together. They came to discuss the chieftainship of Chinamora. They agreed that the chieftainship should be given to Chingoma, the first born of Chidziva.
Why might you dislike this situation? It’s fairly obvious: by accepting the hamper deal you have lost your control over what you buy from the supermarket, and once you are in the habit of buying their hampers, they can raise prices in the knowledge that your other options — buy just a few very expensive items individually or stop using the supermarket altogether — are unattractive to you.
Here in Israel it’s what the British would call Bonfire Night. The articles mentioned above will explain why, but all over the country children set up bonfires in some of the most ridiculous places and the authorities just look on and smile.
Whenever I start a new song, I dont really know where it will end. I never have a clear vision before. I think of a feeling or a moment and let the song grow. When I finished the song, I try to find some lyrics to express that feeling I had. But mostly it is not my intention that the listener will understand every single word. I want the listener to find or lose hisself in a mood without giving words to guide somewhere.
The quotes I think attempt to show that the original Lord Ruler struggled in the beginning and may have been a semi-decent man. This leads me to wonder what went wrong when he assumed power. Why the incessant need to control the masses by destroying everything they knew and forcing them to believe in the Lord Ruler and his form of religion or way of life.

Oh Chip. I bet you thought you had it made every time you confronted those innocuous children, munching away on their Cookie Crisp. Even now, you berate my every cinema trip to see a family-rated movie – from Rango through to Cars 2 - with your airboat and your jetpack, and every single time, no matter how hard you try, you never succeed at getting that delicious cereal.
So I had a “wild hair” and redecorated our kitchen as a retro diner theme. It still is a work in progress, but we got rid of our old table and bought a retro metal table with retro chairs. It looks really cool, but there is a problem. With our old table, we could push all of the chairs in and keep the dogs from jumping up on them and getting on the table. We can’t do that with this new table. The chairs are out just enough for them to squeeze the larger than normal carcasses on to and then up on the table. Well at least one of them does, the other one is a little large and struggles. Thank goodness.

That brings up an interesting dichotomy that happens often to me, both in real life and through this blog. I will take a photo of a wildflower or other interesting plant and I don’t have a clue as to what it is. Some one will identify it and say something to the effect that those plants are rather rare, and ask where I found them. I thank them for identifying the plant in question, then say that those plants aren’t rare to me, I see them all the time at such and such a place. To me, it has always been the finding that has been the most important aspect of being out in nature, correct scientific names has always been secondary, a huge failing on my part.
Local knowledge is richer than any well-researched guidebook. Don’t be afraid to ask for help, tips, or to just set a conversation with a local. Picking their brain will teach you a lot about their customs, culture, and more. Plus, it can be a genuine local experience.
Something you might know: OK. It's the beaning. Thon looked like he was going to be something special for five years until he was drilled in the eye by a fastball from the Mets' Mike Torrez on April 8, 1984. The pitch broke the orbital bone around his left eye and messed up his depth perception. For awhile, it looked like he may never play again. But he returned in '85 and actually lasted until 1993 with some decent seasons. But he wasn't like he was in 1983 -- a potential future Hall of Famer.

BUT, the Upper is a lot tamer. But I don’t know it. And you take off down the river and know you can’t get off till you get to the bottom. And between you and the bottom is an awful lot of river that pours over an awful lot of rock.

Hey, I have some catching up to do. Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, and Happy New Year. Well I have a small break in my school schedule this week.

The pattern is called "Exquisite Baby Cap" and it can be found in "The Tatter's Treasure Chest".
In Old Testament times the Israelites worshipped God in a tabernacle, which pictured God’s holiness and His separation from sinful mankind. Any priest who entered God’s tabernacle first had to sacrifice an animal on the Brazen Altar to atone for sin. Next was the Laver in which the priest washed his hands and feet before he appeared before the Lord—once again a symbol of our need for cleansing from sin.

Thus, in the Gnostic view, salvation from this diminished material realm of suffering and injustice depended less on one’s mere beliefs or on the following of religious laws that the Demiurge put in place, than on the individual’s inner experience of gnosis – a divine knowledge of the cosmic order and one’s true identity. The Gnostic scriptures alluded to Christ’s secret teachings, which would aid the Gnostic to embrace gnosis, and armed with this knowledge, to escape the illusory realm of the Demiurge at the time of death.
There something astonishingly sad about both the futility of John’s actions and about our voyeuristic posturings to see them. For instance, why do we go through such lengths to know John and why does John, alone in the deep space, have to hide in crater? What makes this sculpture such a delight is that these questions are not answered through narrative -- instead the formal elements allow us to feel the interaction between the art and ourselves, to feel our direct relationship with the work.
This demonstrates so well the truth of Hebrews 10:31.
Now, we can look to the British courts to confirm abuses of detainees that our courts and Congress have effectively blocked.
The first goal of the game was also by the Capitals , when a sequence of beautiful passing led to a goal by Mike Knuble. Joel Ward, Keith Aucoin and Mike Knuble had a 3 on 2 break, after Stu Bickel made the mistake of giving up the puck at the blue line. Less than five minutes later, Jason Chimera put the Caps up 2-0. After Matt Hendricks sent the puck deep into the Rangers zone, Lundqvist left the crease to play the puck before realizing he wasn’t going to recover in time. Chimera sent the puck to the crease where Hendricks had the opportunity to backhand it in between his legs but failed to do so. Chimera continued working the puck until it eventually went in off the skate of Ryan McDonagh. Sloppy goal, but the Capitals did take advantage of New York’s mistakes. The Rangers would get on the boards within the final minute of the period, when Brad Richards scored during a 4-on-4. Michael Del Zotto and Marian Gaborik had the assists.

From time to time, we have concerns about channeled messages and it becomes necessary to have another discussion about the subject. The latest is over the allegation that Ashtar does not speak through channelers at this moment. Archangel Michael told me in a personal reading on April 25, that Ashtar does indeed speak through channels. Let’s see if I can find his exact words:
In a thinly populated country, the plantation owners believed they had no choice if they wanted labor to work in their fields. White indentured servants wouldn't do it. You couldn't hire freeborn people for that kind of work. All that. Jut the same, they were spiking the country that had yet to be born.

Funnily enough, I'm not really a bracelet kind of girl but things have changed. I used to wear a crazy amount up my arms during my teeny bopper phase, only for me to switch quickly to wearing none at all because well, they just got in the way. However my friend sent me the little friendship bracelet (so nice to receive mail in HK!) and I bought the plaited bracelet randomly. They go really well together but I'm tempted to remove the tassle because it's just going to get super dirty. Anyway, I'm back on the bracelet bandwagon.

The same sense of Confucian immediacy applies to exiting from a packed bus too. For the Confucian: ‘Shita! My stop’s coming up and half this lot have already shoved their way to the exit door. I’d better shove even harder to make sure I’m off first, otherwise it might never happen and disharmony will occur’. Logic, in contradistinction, approaches things differently: ‘Great! Everyone else is pressing up towards the back of the bus. If I just wait here then I can get off last without being crushed and having my kidneys poked by needle-fingered grandmothers’. Despite knowledge gained through observation and experience the Confucian will repeat the same uncomfortable alighting/exiting behaviour so as not to upset a wider harmony, not to stick out. For the logician this is … well, stupid.
In the prescientific world of 1796, a physician known as Samuel Hahnemann in Germany proposed the basic laws of a practice we all know today as homeopathy. This practice was based on the ‘law of similars’; the idea that ‘like can be cured by like’, which, as we all know, must mean that eating lots of cake cures type 2 diabetes.
The truth is, this isn’t a feminist rant. I am a feminist in the extent that I am absolutely 100% firm in my belief that a woman has a right to choose. They can choose whether or not they want to be a stay home mom, or a working mom. They can choose birth control methods if they want to. They can choose on whether or not to have an abortion because whether or not I agree with it, should not be their concern.
Happy Mother's Day to all!
I've decided that I would really enjoy a black turtleneck. In kind of an authoritarian way. With a tight top bun and a ruler. Not really but for some reason I have not been able to push this beast of a black turtleneck out of my little mind with it's tres chicness and slenderizing profile. This brings me to my next question. Where to get said sweater of darkness, with dual neck choking and warmth enabling capabilities?
You do find that you are stronger and fitter, but some of the improvement has to do with the fact that you know how to do the exercises and you know what’s coming up. Insanity is good anyway… after 6 or so weeks of it I feel great!

We’ve played that way so often this season that seeing us getting absolutely annihilated after 20 minutes, having barely touched the ball, doesn’t even worry me any more (see Brighton away, West Ham away and Southampton away, and that’s only in the last month). It’s just how we play, which might even bode well for next season.
Suspended yards above Thom Yorke, ten large lcd screens dangled from thin, black wiring. They flickered green static and images of all Yorke’s bandmates. The enormous screen behind them resembled a calm body of water. Radiohead was in the middle of playing “Reckoner”, their last song before two encore sets. As the song came to its close, Yorke bowed and exited the stage. The entire stadium of fans roared.

I'll cite specific instances below, but this story turned up in English first, I think, in the English website of Al-Arabiya, was picked up by the tabloid The Daily Mail, and then started to turn up all over the place: in rabid right-wing Islamophobic sites, of course, but also in liberal venues like The Huffington Post. For the right, it proves the morbid perversity of Islam; for the left, it proves the repression of women. Both points might be well taken if anyone had the slightest evidence that any such law exists. No one has produced any.Yet by the time it gets to The Daily Mail, the story has become:

So far I'm about 100 pages into the 1972-73 volume (all grading has been put on hold) and the letters are extremely interesting and shed a lot of light on that particular time in Dick's life: he's just moved to Fullerton from Vancouver; he's broke, alone, and emerging from the darkest year of his life. Letters to lawyers, friends and family, chicks, agents, all delve at length into Dick's problems, interestingly, in almost equal detail whether he's chronicling his troubles to life long friend Ray Nelson, or the snuff vendor, settling up after a check bounced. The writing is incredibly good, in places as funny and as devastating as any of his novels.
If people around us share with us, we will share with others also.
In verses 20-23… Potiphar places Joseph in prison… Because the Lord was with him, Joseph prospered in prison… He was made overseer… the prisoners were under Joseph’s control… God will give you His Divine protection even when you are in dangerous places. During my time of service in WWII, the Lord favored me with Divine protection… His hand was upon me, literally. In one action, an enemy shell exploded in front of me, and the soldier who was with me saw a great big white hand pull me down. When I got up, my rifle and machine gun were demolished but I was unharmed… The soldier just kept staring at me. He told others… God can prosper and protect you even when you are in bad situations. Believe it… I know… We are living in perilous times… The Lord wants to be with you in times like these. Joseph had a heart for God… He took God seriously… and God prospered him… Are you a blessing in your workplace?… The Lord can show you mercy and give you favor just as he did for Joseph (Genesis 39:21).

Sarah from Sweet Times in 2nd--I was so interested in what Sarah was saying about student led conferences. Although she teaches second grade, this type of conference is mandatory in intermediate grades in her district. I asked her to write a blog post on that, so I could get some more information on it! :-) She also has a giveaway going right now for a cute Mardi Gras unit.

My friend let me stay. I told him I just needed time and he was very concerned for me and agreed not to call Jack until I was ready. He wanted to help me but neither of us expected it to turn into four days. I finally agreed to let him call and tell Jack I was safe after the first night. I'm still not sure how that phone call went.

After a couple of hours, contractions started to happen regularly- about every 3 minutes. They were not intense though- just regular. We walked around my neighborhood a few times to see if we could get them to intensify- but to no avail. They did keep coming though. We started doing pressure points- and immediately after my hubby- his name is Dan- would apply pressure to the inside of my ankle, an intense contraction would follow. So, every time I started to contract he would apply pressure.

Frank Gorshin really tries to bring the Riddler to life but he doesn’t have much to do. Still, in many ways Gorshin gives the most impressive performance in the film because the guy is totally committed to this character. Whether he’s at the front of a scene or lurking in the background, Gorshin always gives the Riddler something to do.

On Monday, still no box of checks, but I received and deposited the replacement check for $265. I discovered the downside to the check card because I could not use it for daycare tuition and after-school care, as they are both old-fashioned institutions and require checks. On Tuesday I discovered that, again!, that the replacement check has been "returned" and now I have a hold on my checking account for $530. Luckily, payday had come and gone, so I had some wiggle room. But still!
Sometimes, you meet someone so fucked up that it offers perspective on how fucked you are yourself. That’s alright, it’s a good thing. Everything’s relative. I’ve met these people with frightening frequency all my life, disregard what reflection that casts on the friends I make or the life I live. You were never like that. I saw how messed up I was in contrast to how perfect you were. Are. I don’t know anymore, sometimes I worry if what I idealize in you was just a mirage that my subconscious cooked up to make living tolerable, but even the hope that it was reality warrants this. Perhaps you weren’t perfect. Perhaps you were as flawed as I was, but the hope that you were perfect for me warrants this.
It’s still snowing and the prediction is for several more inches by morning. Will probably be heavy snow as the temps are still pretty high. Sure wish you all were here!
My favourite wrestler was a guy called Sammy Lee. On the posters they used to make out he was related to Bruce Lee, all lies or course, but it put a few extra bums on seats. Many years later I would learn that Sammy Lee (real name Satoru Sayama) became a true legend of Japanese wrestling, when he took on the alter-ego of the legendary NJPW (New Japan Pro Wrestling) wrestler 'Tiger Mask'. Tiger Mask was such a huge hit in Japan, that after Sayama left, a whole series of replacements took on the role, and to my knowledge, there is still a Tiger Mask in action today! Sayama was also a hit in the American WWF in the 1980s. He was years ahead of his time in the 1970's and his speed, agility and high risk all action moves were very much at odds with the lumbering beer bellies, and old boys. Unfortunately Lee was often paired up as a tag team partner with Big Daddy, but his solo matches were dynamite.
Have we got anything in common?
This week is going to have different goals. I want to catch up on my expanding reading list, at least to get through my new books. Anything else I get done of my regular goals will be bonus, though I intend to still do my rounds of visiting other check-ins. I'll be doing lots of winter preparedness this week, the joys of living out in the country. We did get the majority of the snow fence put up already. But there's finishing it, attaching the snowblower to the tractor and removing the mower deck, cleaning the garage, packing the emergency essentials bag, fixing the truck and attaching the plow, and so much more. Oh joy. Boo winter.

Of course you know we are in Concord awaiting a second surgery for Russ-prostate. Date is April 5. I have been having trouble with posting lately and am trying one more time.

I ended up running with another girl who was kind enough to keep pace with me. I tried to keep up with her, and soon realized I needed to be the pace setter.
Gigli, Gigli, Gigli; words can not truly express how much I did not want to see this. Just reading the synopses last one night and I knew I was in for a two hour run of torment. To this day I remember seeing the commercials and trailers for the film when I was just a kid and wondering what was so great about it. Watching it now years later, I'm glad I had some sort of intelligence when I was a kid to stop my friends and myself from sneaking into it and seeing Freaky Friday instead (which also sucked, but way less than Gigli so I consider that a victory). Still, I guess we need to accept that not all bad movies will be so bad that they are good like our favorite Ed Wood classics. In any case, I dove into this one pretty much blindly and with minimal research on my part (a rare occurrence I would later both favor and regret).
He caused no small stir among the Romans at Philippi. He was doing the same among the soldiers of Jerusalem. The centurion said to Lysius, “take heed what thou doest; for this man is a Roman.” Why did he need the warning? It would have been contrary to Roman law for one of its citizens to be punished wrongfully, without a fair trial. Lysius would be in great strife had this gone ahead. We can only guess at the possible repercussions.

But this week, I didn't think about my blog. Not much, anyway. Last weekend, in addition to the usual blur of ballet and swimming lessons, Christian and I went to the school Trivia Night for an evening of fundraising and frivolity. I had a great time, especially since I successfully bid for three months of boot camp in the silent auction. Boot camp baby!!!! (Yes, some of the other mums did think I was in fact quite mad, but I got $570 worth of boot camp for $65....and now I have someone to help me find the more shapely bottom underneath my saggy one. Boot camp baby!!!!!)

I have this theory about boredom. I think it is the cause of a great deal of mischief in people’s lives and even may underlie why nations go to war. Even the current turmoil throughout the Maghreb and the Middle East may have an element of boredom as people grow tired of their current despots and seek to overthrow them.

Second, as you are no doubt aware, last month the state of California began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Yes, we’ve seen this before (Massachusetts), but what makes this threat so grave is that California—unlike Massachusetts—allows non-residents to get married, even if they are from one of the 48 states that still prohibit so-called same-sex “marriage.”
The sacrifice of adoption makes my heart ache, for I know on this Mother's Day another woman will be thinking about my daughter—her daughter. As I rejoice, I'll be crying tears for her. I'll also be sending up prayers that God will wrap His arms around her in a special way.
You will be happy to note that Borges didn’t bother to post all of this prolific evidence to the contrary.

The best way to find an aromatherapist is through personal recommendations. You may want to consider asking family and friends for a referral if they have used an aromatherapist in the past. Your goal is to find the specialist that you trust, who is qualified, and who is reliable.

Her dramatic death unleashed a tidal wave of speculation. Alex Jones and his Infowars organization pointed out that Palfrey had repeatedly stated in interviews that she would not commit suicide and stated that if she was found dead it would really be murder. Her mother had no signs that she was suicidal, and some handwriting experts claimed that the suicide note was either forged or written under compulsion. Journalist Dan Moldea told Time that Palfrey had told him she would commit suicide before enduring prison again, but Jones pointed out that Moldea has a known history of fabricating quotes. In the end, it doesn’t really matter whether she put the noose around her own neck or it was put there by men in black: it was murder in any case. There is no moral difference between directly executing a victim, inducing her to kill herself by threats against her mother and sister, or driving her to suicide via persecution, robbery, psychological torture and the looming threat of a horrible jailhouse death by rape, torture and disfigurement. “Suicide” has been the preferred method of execution for women who embarrass the rulers of decaying republics since at least Roman times, and the purpose of the kangaroo court which precedes the murder is merely to humiliate the victim, to tantalize her with false hope of acquittal and to allow the sleeping masses the illusion that there is still such a thing as justice.

* Acupuncture. Many moms-to-be say that acupuncture helps with aches, pains, headaches, morning sickness, fertility, inducing labor, whatever you may need...Toward the end of my pregnancy, Toby was facing forward in my belly--sunny-side up!--but he should have been facing back. My doctor was concerned that I'd have a more difficult labor if he didn't turn himself around. On a friend's recommendation, I went to the wonderful Sharon Yeung at Five Seasons Healing for an acupuncture session, which was incredibly relaxing and soothing. And by next doctor's appointment, Toby had turned!

Perhaps it was because of the frequency jammers used for the first time in a Malaysian rally. This is one of the reason that Bersih failed to disperse the crowd because the message did not reach down to the crowd. I made my way to Masjid Jamek to pray.
He did explore his own connection to the sacraments. He may have given his child impromptu communion and, at least by Tim Powers’s account, considered that he might have the same capacity to give confession. Still, these practices were inconsistent at best and lacked the constancy and depth characteristic of religious practice. They were treated by those around him as signs of his eccentricity and, to some extent, his unwillingness to push further in that behavior indicates he, on some level, capitulated to this ‘Dick-the-eccentric’ characterization.

Today the scene has changed completely. The first impression is one of grimness and austerity. The ordinary Frenchman is now dressed in a vile garment known as a canadienne, or shapeless reefer jacket with fur collar, knickerbockers, white German socks and hobnailed boots, with or without leather gaiters buttoned to the knee. So dressed he goes to work, to dine or to the cinema, or strolls along the boulevards looking the women critically up and down.
Our good friends are up and moving to Portland. We are truly going to miss them. Who's going to be our regular Friday night dinner dates? Their beautiful girl turns three in a few weeks, and they decided to combine the two events - an early birthday party with a goodbye party. It started out as a simple gathering with pizza and beer. Then the birthday girl had an adorable black and white dress with bumblebees on it... and all of a sudden, it morphed into a full-on shindig with a theme and tons of good eats (including homemade lumpia and adorable s'mores pops!). Nanette sent me a photo of Em's dress and some thought-starter photos. She asked for lemon with lemon curd and lemon or vanilla frosting. They were expecting 50+ guests, so I wanted a large base layer to feed most of the party plus a top layer shaped like a beehive for decoration and extra servings.

I'm thinking of people who give up their lives in order to take care of aging parents, who don't deserve to die alone in enormously expensive warehouses for the elderly or infirmed. "Important" people have the luxury to forget their parents...and give them the "best institutions" money can buy!
Most men have been on the other side of this at times. I know I have and it's not fun. I did my undergrad at the University of Florida and our ratio was 52% men/48% women. As a result, it was tough at times getting dates (sure, some said it had to do with trivial factors like personality, but I found it so much easier to just blame it all on the bad ratio). And proof of that came for me the first time I spent the weekend at FSU for a football game. The ratio at FSU was the reverse--so there were 52% women. I still remember my shock when a woman come up to me at a bar and asked if she could buy me a drink. In all my years at UF that had never happened to me. I was so certain one of my friends put her up to it that I kept looking around the bar for one of my laughing friends.

The song was recorded on March 2nd, 1964 at Radio Recorders in Hollywood, in a pretty productive session for the forthcoming Roustabout movie, that also spawned Little Egypt, Poison Ivy League and It's A Wonderful World.

The King was still using the crème de la crème of musicians at this time, with the likes of the Jordannaires, Scotty Moore, DJ Fontana, Bob Moore, Boots Randolph, Buddy Harman, Billy Strange and Barney Kessel.

President Obama seems increasingly uncomfortable in domestic US settings, but highly energised when speaking abroad, especially to audiences that are traditionally anti-American. Which is why, if he loses in 2012, which is now increasingly likely, he might see the position of UN Secretary General as a natural fit. It bothers me, because I'm just trying to get laughs, and they're trying to take over the world. I should have the advantage.

You can either be a psychological adult or a psychological child. A psychological adult is like a painter. The brush is in his hand and he has the choice of strokes. He creates what he chooses to create. A painter is a choice maker. A psychological child is like a painting. It is a consequence of the painter`s choices. It has no say in what it is becoming. A painting is a mere consequence receiver. Mona Lisa may be the world`s finest piece of art. Yet, it is only a consequence of Leonardo da Vinci`s choices. Millions of Mona Lisas can be duplicated; will there ever be another Leonardo da Vinci?

I didn't actually own either of those colors so I approximated with PTI's Spring Moss and Aqua Mist. The patterned paper also came from Papertrey Ink: Happy Spots. I used one of my favorite Waltzingmouse sets: Sewing Box Hugs. The trees on either side of the house were made by cutting some of the flowers in half, and adding some fine leather cord, split at the top, for trunks and branches. The long stem stamp in the set was used to make a set of hedges around the house. Also used some of my vintage mini ric-rac along the bottom and also to make shades in the windows. The final touches were tiny black glass beads, and tiny buttons.
Now she found herself chased, hemmed in, and with no easy escape from the crowding ruins. Beyond the close-packed staring husks of the courtyard, the Ziggurat of the Tyrant rose with stepped sides high up into the afternoon sky to a broad flat top, marking the city center. Scanning ahead, Sharia saw no escape except to hide in the gloom of a ruined building. She chose the closest yawning entrance. Her legs pumped furiously to send her into the shadows, but before she passed into the shade, she heard the stamping dromedaries enter the alleyway behind. War harness jangled as her enemies leapt from their tall-backed steeds and drew their heavy blades.
The main character, Gwyneth, was awesome. A real keeper. Her light and easy sarcasm made me like her instantly. She has her moments of girliness, as she should.

Her best friend, Lesley, is a keeper, too. She keeps a cool head and does research on time traveling devices when Gwyn is in the 1910's having tea with her great great grandmother.

With three years experience of acting of film, Alex has always displayed professionalism and dedication that exceeds his years. He’s specialized somewhat in more flippant characters, something that will work in his favor, as his character in Better Than Most is fighting to save his girlfriend, a seemingly fruitless act, he uses his denial as a mask for the inevitable. However, there is more then enough of the un-familiar to challenge Alex, and as my past dealings with Alex has proven, he performs best when challenged.

There will be a few more days of clean up as I close out my email and spruce up the blog roll.

A universal, global reality is the prerequisite for that ‘competitive edge’ in every area of grown-up life. Private coaching, home tuitions, online tutors … it is a booming shadow business, replicating the classroom outside the classroom.
Newlywed: WeightWatchers… how many points?

And I do this, every single time. I never make that permanent connection.
"I didn't want it changing!" I protest, computer, "Change it back to the previous design."
The results of this during the course were clear. The mixture of hands-on activities and classroom-based discussions, where the delegates were encouraged to give their feedback, led to a significant change in behaviour. By Day 2 they were being more honest with one another which enabled them to be much more efficient in their tasks, and I felt a real bond had formed. This certainly can only have a positive impact on them professionally.
The best part is everyone feels obligated to like at least one spot - unless you are a massive grump - so take those core people who love you and do something with them. I'm thinking this is kind of obvious, but, again, look at the amazing stats below. Maybe it isn't.
They ran a race and someone won and seven others lost. That’s how it works. Some win more than others, but all can lose. Shock and surprised? No I’m not. But then my memory is a lot longer than some others. Frankly it’s good for the sport. I’ve said all year that the sport needs rivalries and that we need to tout more than one or two athletes. Bolt v Gay can be exciting for the sport – especially when there is a question as to what the outcome might be. Predictability leads to boredom – and that’s the last thing this sport needs. We need excitement. Look at how much discussion this one race has elicited! Imagine what four or five races/events like this a week could do for track and field.
(Here's how my living room looked around 18 months ago)
I hope someone feels like joining me, but either way, I will enjoy writing and sending my letters and hope six people have an extra skip in their step as they walk away from the letterbox knowing they have a real letter and not just bills to read for the day.

For the toffee sauce
it was a great night seeing friends we have not seen for awhile. it was fun catching up with them and getting reacquainted once more especially with everyone's busy schedule. it was really nice to take time and see each other again before the even busier holiday season is here!

So…Evil Feathers. You win. Haha though – you’re stuck right on the butt of the Evil Cute costume…nanana-boo-boo. (In other words – you don’t really win, you just think you do).
In 1986, my bedroom window at Vermont & Mariposa looked at the sunset over Sutro tower. The other side of it seemed like a foreign land, like on the other side might be the other side of the world, where someone had told me their sun comes up when ours goes down and they start their day as we are going to bed. It didn't occur to me that on the other side of it was just the Sunset, where we had moved to Potrero Hill from a house at 2206 39th Avenue. A Chinese family had bought it in probate and wanted to sell it to my parents. They had it appraised around $108,000. My dad couldn't really see the value in it, and neither was really ready for the commitment.
Somewhere out there, there is another version of myself, a thirty-something stay at home mom in an unbroken home, with two kids, her own house, a cozy (real) fireplace, with no financial worries, who doesn’t find any beauty.
“Well how long have you been, um, working for Sal?”
Ted asked if I had any problems to heal and I said no. There are what I would call ‘niggles’ in my life, but nothing serious, and it is all in progress for repair at the moment. So we started a general treatment. Somehow Ted knew exactly which issues to clear up, bearing in mind we had only spoken briefly that morning and had not met before this event. He talked me through an energy meditation and I felt the power pulsing through my body. Physically I shivered a couple of times, and I felt my charkas responding. Then Ted moved to focus on my head and things really took off.
-Was there anything useful in your experience up until now as a working adult that helped you develop these characters?
As for evidence of spinning itself, it seems to go back a very long time before recorded history, but nobody really has any idea how old it is, as far as I can tell. Ancient pots are embellished with patterns created by pressing a cord into the wet clay. The Greeks of Homer said that spinning was taught to humans by Athene, who turned Arachne into a spider for getting too good at it. The Navajo say they learned it from Spider-Woman.
On that note - keep sharing about Give1Save1 to all your friends a family! Those dollars have come a LONG way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will share the grand total with everyone on Sunday! Thanks again!!!!
Last month I found Grey Luster Girl's framed thread holder tutorial on pinterest and flipped out! I knew I was going to try this as soon as I saw it, just with my own little spin! :)

There are very few of us who know just what all of Obama's Czars do, as they quietly go about their "work" in the nation's capital. This listing of their names and job descriptions should be educational to all Americans, no matter what your political leaning. See who they are and realize what they want to do:
In part 2 of this article, we will get into the specifics of what the BDC will do to retain and develop business for each department in the dealership!
We headed buck up the channel and have moored up with another boat on the Wiggenhall moorings for the night.
"This war," Sergeant Cooper said, "weapons barely matter."
Super easy to make because there is no butter to have to work into the flour. The fat that the butter usually supplies is in the heavy cream you use. Flour, baking powder, sugar, salt and heavy cream. If you mix it with a light hand, and treat it somewhat gently you are rewarded with light, tender, delicious biscuits! I served mine with just a little butter on them, along side some chicken tenders I made. The next day I used them to make sausage and egg biscuits. They were delicious both ways. Melissa used hers with sausage gravy...I sure could go for a plate of that right now...maybe I will go whip up another batch of these for lunch! :)
Mouthfeel was medium, not overly carbonated but creamy with some "rough" edges. I later found out that the creaminess probably comes from the oats added to the mash.
Note that the third step is not strictly speaking finitist but formal: it requires taking the distributivity of product over a summation as axiomatic if induction is not accepted. This justifies the following:
Candle tells Cupcake that he knows exactly how it feels being left out, since all his fancy brothers and sisters (Number Candle, Stripy Candle, Twisty Candle, Super-Long Candle, etc.) were picked too, leaving him behind, alone as well. Candle decides that the only thing Cupcake is missing, that would make him feel special is a cool topping. So he sets off in search of a special topping to help cheer up Cupcake. He brings back pickles and spaghetti and peas and even a squirrel, which leaves a nut on top of Cupcake's head.
I’ve written when I’m tired and when I’m really tired and when I’m really, really tired. Soon I’ll be ready for really, really, really tired. And yes, I did notice my tense didn’t match in the first sentence of this paragraph. I’m also not doing much editing. Just occasional misspellings and the rest is a quick edit in my head.
The 70 year old Alje van Deemter and his wife Annemarie (70) were attacked in their house in the crime-ridden Bloemspruit area, on Saturday morning. Mr van Deemter's arm was seriously injured as he tried to prevent being hit on the head with a hammer. Mrs van Deemter had a knife held against her throat. The attacker(s) wore face masks.
happy friday. have a happy, wonderful weekend.
I was in shock. And pretty pissed, mind you. This bitch looked like she had been rode hard and put away wet a LOT in the 70's, before I was even born. She was NOT cuter than me (this said while crossing my arms and stomping my foot like a toddler). Had I not been drunk, I know it wouldn't have bothered me. Anyway, I told Tara about it, and she laughed, and we made fun of middle aged lady all night. It was pretty fun.
I decided to choose the book Shadow, by Michael Morpurgo, because I absolutely BAWLED while reading it. This is the same guy who wrote War Horse, and while I think that movie sounds good, I’m definitely more of a dog person than I am a horse person so I immediately thought THIS book should’ve been done instead.
Although I suspect that I may need to help my children eat those eggs so they don't go off / make a mess / make their teeth fall out / some other rubbish excuse to eat my children's chocolate.
Is she progressing with toilet training? No. Not really progressing. Plateau. She’s kind of had it down for almost a year. Nights and all.
For some odd reason I continually get waylaid from my scrappy plans and end up doing something that is equally scrappy but still not accomplishing my scrappy goals! This time it's box cars. I had no clue what a box car was but 3 weeks ago I was informed we were racing them and I would have to make them for my babes. Of course everything that her big brothers do in cubscouts, little miss Aubrey Lu has to do as well.
“Let’s sit in the hot tub tonight,” Addy said. The doggy momma owned a fancy hot tub, which she had offered to us.
I am looking forward to continuing on my quilting evolution at The Storytellers weekend as I will be taking classes from two great quilters. Juanita Yeager's "Paint it, Quilt it" class where you learn to use watercolor pigments to create a quilt top design, then learn free motion quilting techniques to enhance the design. This is a recent piece by Juanita... look at the shading and texture in this flower. Yummmm
So, the testers enlisted someone with chronic wrist pain and some nasty-sounding medical conditions with Latin names, and Woods agreed that she’d be able to tell this lady’s wrist apart from a healthy equivalent in another person. And indeed, in the preliminary “open” test, her magic powers seemed to be working fine. Ten times in a row, she tried using TT to detect the energy field from the injured wrist, and she got it dead on the money every time. Pretty impressive… but not really. The open test meant that she could see whether she was waving her hands over the woman with the wrist problem or the healthy chap. Under those circumstances, yes, therapeutic touch seems to work amazingly well.
So there's a little peek into what's getting us into the Spring Spirit! Hope y'all are having a Hippity Hoppity Friday! Peyton's not feeling all that well today so we're having a pajama and movie day...currently we're watching Toy Story 2, its sure to be a great day with this combo!
As the end of the year arrives, and you are reading the lists of “the best”, “top 10”, “the most fascinating”, keep in mind what they mean for you and your business and how you can use them to generate revenue. Trying what others have done isn’t bad business… it is ok NOT to re-invent the wheel.
Then a few minutes later, while others are commenting nice things about the photo, you step back into your reality..
I hope that you like and I promise it wont be as long next time.
Life is sweet I like this because I have a crazy sweet tooth, so the sight of cupcakes always makes me smile. Plus, it reminds me of a favorite song of mine Life Is Sweet by Natalie Merchant.

BAD STUFF: They never did explain that chicken :)
Love this one of my (2nd) cousin jumping on the trampoline at my mom's. He had sooo much fun! I used the trampoline from Everyday Paper Dolls.
Wine tasting client events have gained traction. They’re enjoyable, profitable and a great way to tie in top client relationships while meeting new potential clients. Over the past year I’ve been hearing more-and-more about elite advisors employing these into a marketing plan. Because thinking about the wine drinkers…aren’t they probably part of your ideal target market?
“Inmate Wiles has been respectful and compliant with staff,” said JoEllen Smith, spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. “He did have a few brief moments where he became emotional upon his arrival, but his overall demeanor has been the same, which has been respectful, cooperative and compliant with our staff.”

Well today has been a mixed bag: we went to see the Crazy Horse Memorial, which is good, but the Trek is still not fixed, which is bad. Let me explain...
Last night marked our fourth consecutive Morchok H kill (and our first without any deaths or wipes) and thanks to the 20% buff we shaved about 30 seconds of our kill time. Immediately afterwards we went back to work on Yor’shaj H. Even with the buff Yor’shaj continues to give us problems and require a lot of work on our end to succeed. Tonight we will also be working on Ultraxion H for the 3rd week (we have about 8 attempts in so far). Our best attempt was 50% health with 2:30 left for enrage. We are way behind the DPS mark, but most people need time to become comfortable enough with mechanics to reach their max potential in healing and damage dealing, so I’m not terribly concerned.
Where’s the beef?
Loved the romantic interest! Chase was really cute and had Hartley all tied up in knots from the beginning. I’m really looking forward to seeing how they move on with the relationship in future books. But I must say…it’s more of a tease than a spoiler…that scene under the bed…take it off! lol I totally would have let him keep stripping. Yes, this is wrong of me, No, my teenage self would have stopped him too…but my adult self was distracted by the abs! Oh *sigh* the abs on the muscular literary guy with great hair…as much of a work of fiction as the ability to choke someone with iPod ear-buds.
Evolutionists make utterly groundless claims regarding the supposed evolution of insects, as they do with all other living things—and they themselves are well aware of this.
One morning this past August I woke up and felt like I had literally been hit by a semi truck while I was sleeping. I ached all over. It hurt to move. And I thought to myself - What the hell did I do yesterday? I couldn't remember doing anything particularly out of the ordinary. So I thought maybe I had some sort of a virus.
The DVD comes with a CD with original live music from BACKYARD! Get it or forever repent!
Anyway those talents are displayed, practised, in the Greenaways solid double bed and Delia is not reluctant in that respect. It is only that Raymond does like to refer to it in a way Delia finds embarrassing, and does seem always to be thinking about it. There are other things to be thinking about. The choir, singing, for instance.
“Despite huge improvements to what’s on the menu, teenagers are still not choosing food combinations that will give them enough energy and nutrients to stay alert all afternoon.”

dark chocolate every day: it will control your cravings and benefit your body. 91 percent of American women crave chocolate; it contains natural substances that create a sense of euphoria. We already know that it boosts levels of serotonin and dopamine, which improve your mood and significantly reduce stress hormones; but other beneficial chemicals are also included in chocolate: Phenylethylamine, the substance that your brain releases when you fall in love, and Theobromine, which boosts circulation and is a possible aphrodisiac. Women who ate dark chocolate for seven days saw their “bad” cholesterol drop by 6 percent and their “good” cholesterol rise by 9 percent.
The mountain adventure continues as the young group try to reach shelter and safety on a stormbound glacier, with more than a few hiccups along the way.
At an event, be it an author, publisher, or blogger organised event, a blogger meets an author (not the author who's event it is) who's debut will be released in a fair few months time. Blogger and yet-to-be-published author, along with others that are at the event, chat books and everything to do with them. They may chat a little bit online after the event, on Twitter via reviewer & author blogs. As in Situation A, they know each other, they have conversations, and they get on, but aren't the bestest of buddies. When the book is close to being published, the blogger is sent a review copy.
8. Worship a God of Sleep. Hypnos, Morpheus, and Somnus are just a few ancient gods who govern the universe’s sleep. The next time you find yourself tossing and turning in bed unable to sleep, convert to any one of their religions, build a stone altar in an empty field, sacrifice a live bull or a young goat, smear yourself with that animal’s blood and set the meat offering on fire. Once the smell of the roasting meat reaches their divine noses (and if they are pleased with your offering) I am sure sleep is on its way!
Even in Morgoth’s nethermost hell, Húrin sees something like the clear “shaft of light” that Master Samwise would see in Mordor several thousand years later: there was light and high beauty forever beyond the Shadow’s reach.
Like I said, this book shakes up a lot of things in regards to the faith. It rearranges the way you’ve maybe looked at things for a long time — it did for me, anyway. But, I like the new way of looking at things, as it makes the reading of certain Bible passages make a lot more sense to me… some that were confusing before now seem more clear.
And a couple of you asked about the Inktense blocks... and what they were... they are chunky water soluble ink blocks... and once you add water... they become like translucent ink-like paint...
Have I ever mentioned I hate hypochondriacs?
A lazy-holic is addicted to being lazy. We all know her. She is the one who procrastinates about everything, manages to get some things done but would much rather be on the couch watching the most recent episode of whatever recorded on the DVR. I masked my lazy in bursts of industry, the laundry got done, the family got fed, the house got cleaned but I was still lazy. The dogs didn’t get walked…they have a back yard after all…why do they need to get walked every day? A lazy-holic considers physical activity with reservation and resignation rather than joy and the sense of well being.

Salarymen go out drinking on average 2.9 times a month, spending about 4,190 yen ($46) each time, a 19 percent decline from a year earlier, according to a Shinsei Financial Co. online survey. That buys five pints of Sapporo Draft at Coopers, a British pub, in central Tokyo.

Chottu a delightful and self-assured and extremely intelligent kid, learns languages from tourists and picks up a lot of knowledge from books that he is given by the little prince and others. If there is an honest bundle of integrity, confidence and grit that represents my image of young Indian boys, it is Chotu as played By Harsh Mayar, who is incidentally on facebook!

In Acts 9:6, the message from the Lord from Heaven was, “Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou shalt do.” The first step is to go to Damascus. Then, the Lord would give him the next step. He was to walk by faith; not by sight.
Speaking on their behalf, Pantai Jerejak assemblyman Sim Tze Tzin said the final straw for Wang was when she tried to get her pay, which had been withheld since last December, but was rebuffed.
I thought about getting another set of wheels, made up with the off-road tyres and a sprocket of a suitable ratio but after weighing up the pros and cons of buying or building another set of wheels, I revisited an interesting bicycle supplied by Edinburgh Bicycle Cooperative, their own branded Revolution Track.

The regulars were in here, that being the bar staff of course. Brother Rabbit, Ashford, Jaipur and Brock made up an equally drab/exciting roster of Thornbridge ales, of which I had the Brock. The pumpclip declares a smooth creamy stout - it was admittedly smooth but there was almost no creaminess and far too much dry hops in this beer to allow it to fulfil the tastes promised. Unfortunately, a tight schedule meant I did not have time to taste the Jaipur, which I'd been hoping to. The Kipling is the new key keg for now. Jamie reports more Magic Rock on the way, potentially cask Dark Arts. That would be a real coup if it shows up.
Consequently, when CD opened on 125th street, I was in that bad boy every week, (Black &) proud to support their company and Mary and Jada. While I don’t share the skin tones or features as these women, it is their persona that I related to. I respected them. So when my girlfriend and I discussed Cassie, Solange and Selita, she couldn’t wrap her mind around why I didn’t dig these choices since exact skin tone hadn’t matter to me before. I simply said, “I don’t see myself in any of those ladies.” Not my looks, my style, my spirit, my anything. Reading Steve Stoute’s articulation of CD’s choice also transported me back to my awkward years. I was that young girl seeking someone to see myself in, to say that Dark Chocolate is beautiful too, that we fully embrace the full color spectrum of our sisters and want to praise them ALL.
"We've never seen anything like it," he said. The previous high was 858 in 1996, the year after Timothy McVeigh, a militia sympathizer, and Terry Nichols, a sovereign, killed 168 people, the nation's deadliest terrorism attack after Sept. 11.''
The authors report the unexpected finding of enterovirus VP1 protein, by immunoperoxidase staining, in carcinoid tumours found in one patient with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and another patient with chronic lower quadrant abdominal pain, and suggest a possible association between enteroviruses and tumorigenesis.
Not one country efforted to stop this travesty from unfolding.
I can't heap all the blame for a lack of vision onto the Government though, schools and teachers need to shoulder some of it too. Coincidentally, over the last 3 months, I've been visiting schools and talking to headmasters, one of my stock questions is "what strategy or plan do you have to take advantage of the changes to the ICT curriculum?" - guess what, not a single school I spoke to has a plan (at least not one that the Headmaster knows about anyway!) Most of the time I get a goofy response like "Oh computers, don't know much about how all that stuff works but aren't iPad's wonderful" - PATHETIC!

As this is a Hummingbird cake I am entering it into this month's Alphabakes challenge that I am hosting as the magic letter is H. I baked this several months ago before I had started this blog, and kept meaning to add it as a new post, so now seems as good a time as any!

I can see the dark flecks and super slight shimmer, and I do think that the subtle details make it neat. Neutrals and I rarely get along, though, especially neutrals that aren't at all complimentary to my skin tone.
Leaving without a word
I haven’t heard much about this and I have no idea how it’s going to go but I’m certainly intrigued and the little I have heard has been quite good.
It is so beautiful.
Happy birthday, Victory! Keep at it, we'll keep drinking.
So, here’s what I am reading… enjoy!
She told me that being a blogger gives her the right to post whatever she wants about whomever she wants, and she has no idea why I would be remotely hurt since she has never actually 'said my name' in a blog post. She said I am only looking to be offended and draw attention to myself, and that I 'should have known' that the photo of me would end up on her blog. I have only said one thing to her via facebook when I asked her to remove my photo from her hurtful post about me, which I then quickly deleted, and yet she claims I keep attacking her. I have only briefly and respectfully responded to her blog post in her comments. She told me I am no longer 'welcome' to read her blog, while she freely blogs about me. I find it interesting that she is so hurt and upset over my few sentence response to her that I promptly deleted, yet she can't understand why I would be hurt by 3 whole negative blog posts about me... in which several of our mutual friends see what she writes. Logically, it just does not make any sense. Here is my ultimate point in even speaking up here:
However, Dreams adverts are only slightly more offensive than all the other inter-racial sex promotions which are deliberately pumped into our lives day after day, and a lot of it is more subtle.
Until recently, Gary read Garfield comics one or both boys at bedtime. Only now that they often stay up later than the old folks has that become rare. Still on occasion, as we head into winter with more indoors time, Dan has requested evening reading time with Dad.

I heard him give an impromptu speech at a writer’s conference several years ago. The conference was at Wheaton College. Chuck Colson was speaking at another conference at the college. Robert Walker, who ran the conference, saw him and asked him to stop by and say a few words to us. I don’t remember what he said but I remember feeling awe.
Sorry that, when no one in the world was on your side, I sided with the world.
Taking our country over and dying for Allah is in your indoctrinated delusional belief system because your false prophet Mohamed laid it down in the manual (the Koran) of your death cult Islam when the devil birthed his lie into our world many centuries ago. There are many of us who are now rising up, who are well aware of you, your evil and your warmongering murderous Islamic aims and intentions aimed at us and our children. You and your Al Qaeda leaders are the ones who have forced us into the position we are now in, in which we clearly have only two choices to decide from; we either continue saying nothing and sit back, talking, watching and accept the eventual Islamification of our Nation and destruction of our children’s futures or we stand up and stamp out your Islamic inspired, Al Qaeda led Jihad against us, our British homeland and our children’s futures.
My mother’s heels snap on the marbled floor. She clicks her tongue impatiently as we walk. She wants me to hurry and make a decision, even though we’ve only just arrived. “Do you know which one you want?” she asks.

Do the little things count in the handmade industry? I think they do. Personally I think it's one of the attractions of buying from a small handmade business. I think it is what sets our industry apart from the impersonal nature of large corporations.

The alert goes out from a taxi driver or a street vendor, equipped with a high-end handheld radio and paid to work as a lookout known as a “halcon,” or hawk.The radio signal travels deep into the arid countryside, hours by foot from the nearest road. There, the 8-foot-tall (2-meter-tall) dark-green branches of the rockrose bush conceal a radio tower painted to match. A cable buried in the dirt draws power from a solar panel. A signal-boosting repeater relays the message along a network of powerful antennas and other repeaters that stretch hundreds of miles (kilometers) across Mexico, a shadow communications system allowing the cartel to coordinate drug deliveries, kidnapping, extortion and other crimes with the immediacy and precision of a modern military or law-enforcement agency.
It's the home of the Fyfe Brewing Company which has been going for 17 years and I was hoping that there would be a couple of their beers on, but unfortunately not. The engaging owner told me that he now only brews a maximum of once a week and has also recently been having problems with his Nottingham yeast, so the in-house beers have been a bit less frequent. A shame, since I think I'd only ever had 2 of their beers (a long time ago), but I was more than mollified by the impressive line-up available that afternoon.

At his recent State of the Union Address, President Obama made it clear that the devaluing of the dollar and America’s reliance on credit are both continuing and disconcerting issues as we steam ahead in 2011. As a Personal Financial Planning major, I understand the need for people to get financial advice as investing and budgeting are very complex topics. In light of all this, I see a huge problem: my peers are out of touch of what is going on around them.
Here in SoCal, the world stops with a speeding drop of rain. I can’t imagine a major catastrophe here. As I picked my way through the markets this weekend, I was grateful for our consistently perfect weather, which contributes to consistently great produce. Can you ever have too many tomatoes? No, I don’t think so. I use what I grow in the garden, supplemented by heirlooms from Valdivia~

I finally had the email I was waiting for…and a second on top. The publisher had requested more chapters from Ignite. No problem. I had a couple that I had worked on since speaking to them last, but they needed a SERIOUS overhaul. The second email is what threw me into a tizzy: they wanted to read the full manuscript for Defiance Rising, which I was in the process of rewriting. AAAHHH!!
I thought that sound would never grow old

Firstly, you may have noticed that if you ask a stranger to do something—especially to buy something—they tend to balk. Their natural reaction is to question the instruction. To find a reason to disagree with it. The critical mind throws up objections.
So, what's next?
We had plans to use the basement as a painting studio for the kids. We also wanted it to be a place where they could use riding vehicles on stormy days. We were on a great path organizing the space with shelving systems and bins, then fell off the wagon.
