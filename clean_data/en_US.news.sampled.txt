Defensive coordinator Perry Fewell and his staff. The Giants played exclusively in the nickel Sunday. They switched up the personnel a bit to freshen it up, but they had five DBs on the field for every single play except one, by my count. The loss of middle LB Jonathan Goff has forced Fewell to play mostly nickel this season. But to do it exclusively and to play so well on defense against the Pats for much of the game is a credit to the scheme, the coaches and the players.

The Von Bondies last released an album five years ago, around the time that this decade's garage-rock revival was petering out. What then to make of "Love Hate and Then There's You," which mainly flogs the same formula as its predecessor? Once more we find singer/guitarist Jason Stollsteimer pushing catchy anguish and drummer Don Blum pounding his way to rapture. The riffs are tight, but not so fresh. When they don't evoke vintage Von Bondies, they suggest the Killers or, in the case of a dramatic lead single, "Pale Bride," the British band Bloc Party.

Those themes were ratcheted up in the crawfish etouffee ($7.95/$14.95). It is a stew of the regionally revered mudbugs that is based on a light roux. For a light roux, the oil and flour are cooked for less time, meaning the mix develops less color and flavor but has increased thickening power.

Love: In the meantime, "Good Vibrations" was our answer to that psychedelic era, to what was going on at the time. It's our most successful, unique song that we've ever done.

It was so unique in its use of the theremin. In fact, Rolling Stone said it was the single of the century.

The VO Group representatives also got timeshare owners to send the VO Group money purportedly to have timeshares cancelled or sold.

They were heavily topped with that ubiquitous marinara sauce, which pretty much drowned out the flavor of the delicate crab. Again, a little less would have been better. A generous side of linguine with marinara goes with the crab cakes.

But it isn't enough. Krymov seems so enamored of his inventive stagings - most of which we've seen handled more creatively by other directors - that he lingers on effects long enough to make us wonder what purpose they serve.

This is why I believe the first step following the 2003 invasion of Iraq should have been the privatization of the oil fields. If the government had given every individual over 21 equal shares in a corporation that had the right and responsibility to make appropriate arrangements with foreign oil companies for the purpose of discovering and developing Iraq's oil reserves, the oil income would have flowed in the form of dividends to the people - the shareholders - rather than into government coffers.

The hurt of disillusionment can cause us to have a wounded heart. There comes a time when we must understand that it is not always necessary to understand. Some hurts and losses will never make sense to us on this side of eternity, but in time and God's economy, we find that all things do work together for the good of those who love the Lord.

The shortcomings on the Davis campus should result in severe punishment -- including possible firings -- for those involved, said Samuel Walker, a criminal justice professor at the University of Nebraska who the UC panel consulted. With Occupy and other protests more common on college campuses, the UC Davis incident should be a lesson, he said.

-- There are exceptions to the clearinghouse and exchange-trading requirements. One is for nonfinancial companies that use derivatives solely to offset business risks. They can still trade derivatives outside exchanges and clearinghouses. And they won't have to set aside money to cover possible losses. They'll have to report their trades to regulators, however.

The disorder is typically treated with anticonvulsants, such as lamotrigine, carbamazapine or valproate. Such drugs are effective in controlling seizures in perhaps as many as 60% of cases. But when the patient fails treatment with at least two different drugs, their epilepsy is said to be medically refractory and they are candidates for surgery. Such surgery removes the area of the brain that is misfiring and causing the seizures. Physicians typically insert electrodes into the brain to identify the source of the electrical disturbance, then remove a small amount of tissue that is involved. The most common type of procedure is called a lobectomy.

After the two other No. 2 seeds in the NCAA Tournament, Duke and Missouri, lost their first games, the last two No. 2s, the Buckeyes and Jayhawks, advanced to New Orleans by beating the top seeds in their regions -- Ohio State taking down Syracuse and Kansas dispatching North Carolina. Those wins said more about each team than a game from December, though what happened then is a point of reference.
Erin Emmans owns Teasers Salon on Main Street and the Thrift Cellar downstairs. The salon is a destination stop for customers, but those customers have been arriving late for appointments since the work began. The Thrift Store relies on impulse shoppers. With no large visual presence to attract passersby and no sidewalk for foot traffic, the shop has felt the effect of the concrete breaking outside. "It will be beautiful when it's finished," Emmans said of her block. "But right now, my customers are not happy."

That's why even if Senator Currie is found innocent he should be removed from office. With all the additional taxes and toll increases being heaped on Maryland taxpayers, we simply can't afford that kind of stupidity in our elected officials — or the cost of paying a public defender to represent them in court after they've been accused committing some stupid act.
These mines are very predatory as they are coming into an economically depressed region of the state and making all sorts of promises about the jobs they will create. And I have no doubt that, were they allowed to proceed, they would create jobs. But for how long? And are we really willing to risk the pristine nature of the Boundary Waters and the safety of Lake Superior which is still recovering from the Reserve Mining fiasco for a decade of employment? Tens of thousands of Minnesotans currently make their livings off the tourism trade in Northern Minnesota. I have to believe that the tourism industry will suffer greatly if suddenly our land is ripped bare and our lakes contaminated with runoff sulfuric acid from mines run by people with the worst possible track records.

The University of Maryland has found that Maryland is among the states most vulnerable to rising sea levels from climate change. While the U.S. Navy is taking the pragmatic approach and is examining the risk from rising sea levels to its installations across the globe, many in Congress would like to pretend that climate change can be talked away with rhetoric borrowed from their fossil fuel industry donors.
None of those players was on the Cowboys Stadium field for the second half of the Packers’ 31-25 victory over the Steelers in Super Bowl XLV. And many of them haven’t been between the lines in months. In all, Green Bay placed 16 players on injured reserve this season. And Sunday night, they lost two more when Woodson broke his clavicle and Driver suffered a high-ankle sprain, while cornerback Sam Shields was very limited.

Kinzel's stewardship of the amusement parks themselves has been "remarkable over the years," said longtime shareholder Janie Riffle of Bellevue, Ohio. She called Cedar Point the best amusement park in the country - clean, well-staffed and well-managed. But even Kinzel admits, she said, that "he's not a financial wizard."
Improved competition typically means less margin for error, Oregon defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti said. Stronger opponents could capitalize on mistakes that might not have been costly against a lesser team. But Aliotti said he hasn't approached the final month viewing these teams as being better, as much as he's focused on his team playing better.
Said Kings defenseman Drew Doughty: "I was right there, so I saw him reach over the bench with the stick because I was looking at Stollie carrying the puck. I saw him reach over the bench and touch it. Obviously he did it. It was no secret. You just throw on the video and you're going to find out."

The result was a gift interception for Falcons linebacker Mike Peterson.

Is there a future for any NBA team with a split personality? The Lakers never seem to know exactly who they are, and the smart money has them falling short in the upcoming Western Conference semifinals, beginning Monday night in Oklahoma City. They would be wise, however, to follow their Game 7 template against Denver, a 96-87 victory that momentarily removed a mountain of pressure from Pau Gasol, Andrew Bynum and coach Mike Brown.
The governors' cooperation hasn't produced a headline-grabbing accord such as the one between O'Malley and McDonnell's predecessor, Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine. Those two stood side-by-side on the banks of the Potomac River in 2008 to announce a ban on harvesting blue crabs in winter months, a development that is credited with a rebound in the population.

Favorite all-time Terp: Marissa Coleman
The lack of consensus among Messrs. O'Malley, Miller and Busch after this morning's meeting, the trio's first face-to-face-to-face since the morning after the session adjourned in chaos, is neither surprising nor particularly dispiriting. It will take time for the ill will and recriminations that followed the session to fade, and the two legislative leaders will need to feel out their caucuses to see where they stand. After taking a beating in their districts, senators and delegates may be much more eager to come together than they were two weeks ago. The public is angry that the governor and legislators didn't do their jobs during the 90-day regular session, and the only way to calm them is to come back in a special session and do the people's business quickly and efficiently. Today's meeting didn't end in a deal, but it at least suggested a path forward.

Vegetables are largely ignored once they hit the grates, when in fact, they require - and sometimes deserve - the most attention. With the right treatment, they can easily be the star of the meal. And, because their time on the grill is short - most need just about 10 minutes' cooking time - even a Fourth of July barbecue can come together quickly.
Two Justice Department officials described the policy, saying prosecutors will be told that it is not a good use of their time to arrest people who use or provide medical marijuana in strict compliance with state laws.

Legislation introduced late last month by Sen. Joe Pennacchio (R-Morris) places some of the burden on the future unemployed. The bill, which formalizes Gov. Chris Christie’s earlier proposal, would reduce weekly unemployment checks by $50 to a maximum of $550. Furloughed employees would take a big hit because the law would include a one-week waiting period for people receiving benefits. It would prevent such employees from collecting unemployment during the first week they are out of work.

In addition, in 2002, the Legislature eliminated the direct mail shipment privileges of New Jersey’s in-state wineries so as to protect our children and to collect all possible revenue.

"While it is unfortunate that the residents of the fourth legislative district will not have full representation in the Assembly until the Supreme Court ultimately decides the case, we believe that the final outcome will be that the voters will have their choice honored and Ms Mosquera will be the Assemblywoman, Tambussi said.

“Do not forget to add in and costs of any improvements that you have made to the cost basis,” Rosen said.
Rarely will someone reply "What exactly do you mean by 'God?'" But research shows that more and more people are thinking about God, and changing their beliefs. One of my teachers told a story of being at a dinner party. When he was introduced as a rabbi, another guest said "Well you know, I don't believe in God." The rabbi replied, "That's OK, I don't believe in the same God you don't believe in."
The report says College Illinois also ignored or changed its criteria for deciding how to invest money that participants put into the program. Meanwhile, costs nearly tripled in just five years.
Q: The popularity of classic films often ebbs and flows over the years, but that never seems to have happened to "The Sound of Music" — singalong screenings across the country, "Sound of Music" tours to Salzburg and now your book. Why are audiences still in love with this movie?
But in an era when anyone with a computer can send out misinformation faster than it can be counteracted or gathered back in, we have had to adjust. "A lie," said Mark Twain (or Charles Haddon Spurgeon, or maybe somebody else), "can travel halfway around the world before the truth can get its boots on." That's especially true today.
It was brief, Beth says. Just some preliminary assessments to determine whether Shannon was a candidate for early childhood intervention.

Corporate earnings results have provided a pleasant surprise, said Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ. After nine straight quarters of growth, earnings for S&P 500 companies were expected to be nearly flat. But eight of every 10 companies that have reported so far, including Coca-Cola and IBM, have beaten estimates. As a result, first-quarter earnings are now projected to rise 4.4 percent, according to S&P.

Jen Brumfield has been chronicling the gull's amazing two-month stay on her blog, northnw.wordpress.com where she warns: "Some days views are distant, and other days, the gull has been seen and photographed point blank from 100 to 400 yards away. Searchers should allow for several hours of searching. This bird is not a quick one-stop shot."

-- Some resorts or hotels base their "regular" rate claim on their high-season price, even when the sale price is limited to off-season visits. That well may be the case in my example: The high-season price for a junior suite at the Caribbean property involved (in mid-February) is actually $306 per night. But November is the middle of the slowest quarter of the year for all Caribbean destinations, and just about everybody there is pushing very low off-season rates.
The Constitution already has language concerning victims' rights, but proponents of the amendment say the change would give victims a way to actually enforce those rights.

Ann M. Evans says: In my grandparents' brown-shingled Berkeley house, the free-standing vintage stove dominated the kitchen. Fresh meringues would emerge from my grandmother's oven to be topped with freshly picked blackberries and raspberries from my granddad's kitchen garden. This is my grandmother's recipe for meringues, slightly modified and not too different from Georgeanne's mother's recipe.
An earlier strike vote failed to pass by about 28 votes. Union bylaws require approval by 80 percent of the membership to authorize a strike.
The Sacramento-based Estrin is now 62. Blues is one genre that appreciates age and the experience it brings. So he has no plans to ease into retirement, as his pal Baty did (to a degree, anyway; Baty still plays local shows). "I want to go out like Robert Lockwood or Pinetop or one of those guys, just do it till I can't do it anymore."
The process got off to a bad start when the first $1 million was spent on a public survey that critics called a waste of money. That was followed by months of political missteps and public-relations debacles related to politically linked firms hired to help spend the donation.

Northeast Ohio continues to have some of Ohio's lowest unemployment rates. Experts attribute lower joblessness to local economies that tend to be more diverse than in parts of the state dependent on one or two industries.
Like other government politicians during the campaign, he clung to familiar themes, citing the start of the bloody independence struggle against France that ended in 1962—rhetoric that has little resonance with the 70 percent of the population that is under the age of 30 and afflicted by a 20 percent unemployment rate.

Even now, as the city faces crisis, "most employees represented by the Coalition of Los Angeles City Unions are scheduled for 11 percent increases in compensation over the coming two years," the Times reported. Given that in February the unemployment rate in the City of Angels was 13.3 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Labor Statistics, it should be unthinkable to even consider raises for public workers.

CLEVELAND, Ohio - In the NFL Draft, there is hope.
Use traps, not poison: After a photo of a bobcat with a mouse for a picnic lunch appeared in a gallery last week at sfgate.com/sports/outdoors, David Tharp of the Bay Area Bobcat Project and several others had a great suggestion: The unintended poisoning of bobcats and other animals, from the use of poison for rats and mice, would be stopped if people instead used traps for rodents.
The biggest example of Steeler bias showed through when Florida scatback and special-teams ace Chris Rainey was taken at No. 159. Rainey has talent, but his name only was whispered in the weeks leading to the draft. Why? Because of health and character concerns -- especially character concerns. All of the drawbacks vanished when the Steelers came calling. Rainey instantly became a multi-talented weapon who automatically will "fall in line."
"This follows three years of salary freezes or modest increases and furloughs," Kaler said during his State of the University address in March. "This rewards all of you who have carried us through some very difficult budgets."

River cruising does tend to draw curious, educated travelers who are interested primarily in the destination ports and spend their cruising time reading and relaxing.

If you look at international fares from five years ago, you're not paying that much more. In 2007, the Travel section's airfare chart showed a flight to Paris for $1,265 in July -- only $20 less than a current fare. Adjusted for inflation, that $1,265 fare would be $1,389 in today's dollars. The one fare that's way out of line is London, which showed up five years ago as $842, or $924 in 2012 dollars. Note that the July 27-Aug. 6 dates correspond with the Olympics, which are a hot ticket.

The Wolstein Group and Fairmount Properties, joint partners in the project, are putting the final touches on their financing package and still hope to break ground within a few months. Plans for the initial development include an office building, a parking garage, stores, restaurants and entertainment venues, as well as 14 acres of green space leading to a riverfront boardwalk.
Analysts say the corresponding lift in world diesel prices provides strong incentives for refiners to maximize diesel production at the expense of gas.

Remember, the Bobcats traded Gerald Wallace to the Blazers (when Cho was still Portland's GM) for three players no longer with them, and they traded Stephen Jackson on draft day. So their two best players from 2010-11 -- when they had a chance at a playoff berth before the Wallace deal -- are gone.

Indeed, much of "West Cross Timbers," Shires’ first solo record, felt as indebted to Willa Cather and Eudora Welty as it does to Emmylou Harris or Dolly Parton. "Carrying Lightning," a collection of love stories, simply seems like the diary entries of a woman whose wanderlust is barely contained by her small town circumstances. Shires, who takes her lyrics as seriously as any prose writer, often uses assignments and exercises to spark her creativity.

I really do believe Colt McCoy can take this team to the next level. Here's why: 1. He had no off-season with his new coaching staff. 2. It was his first year in a system that Holmgren has said takes three years to play fast in. 3. His receivers dropped a league-high 43 passes. 4. His No. 1 receiver was a rusty rookie in Greg Little. His other top receiver, Mo Massaquoi, was a non-factor because of foot injuries and a concussion. 5. His offense was learning on the fly. 6. Seneca Wallace, well-versed in the WCO, refused to mentor him because he wanted the starting job himself. 6. He played most games without Peyton Hillis or Montario Hardesty.
But J.B. Silvers, a professor of health care management at Case Western Reserve University, says Cleveland's major hospital systems are able to fill new specialty hospitals because they've taken over so many private primary-care practices in the area.

More likely, the city would "re-enter" the county as its 92nd municipality. The city of St. Louis would keep its own mayor and aldermen and fire department. But it likely would shed many of the functions that St. Louis County also performs, such as collecting property taxes and running a prosecutor's office and its own courts. It would, governmentally speaking, become a giant urban Kirkwood.

They are vulnerable to a well-played zone, though, or to a gimmick like a triangle-and-2 because opponents can concentrate on Crowder and DJO and not worry much about being destroyed from another angle. Their complementary players are solid but unlikely to beat you in a halfcourt game.

Turning again to what he would have done differently, Christie for the first time admitted a measure of responsibility for staying in Florida during last winter’s blizzard.
This Roscoe Village organic bakery bills itself as offering "punk rock pastry." And if that means many of the goodies are surprisingly inventive, I would have to agree. Sure, you'll find the standards: brownies, cookies, whoopie pies and cheesecake bars, all generously sized, by the way. And there's a gorgeous, postcard-perfect vista of cupcakes on display — about a dozen flavors available each month, four to six of them vegan. However, foodies will appreciate the assortment of thoughtful creations such as chocolate chip cookies with bacon (yes, the bacon is organic), blueberry pie with lavender streusel, basil and goat cheese croissants, tequila-lime cupcakes and ginger-cream scones. And speaking of scones, the vegan Take a Hike scones, made with whole-wheat flour, oats, seeds and dried fruit, are the bakery's best-seller. Most items are sweetened with evaporated cane juice. Extra bonus: With its tattoo-art touches and neon-hued walls and tables, the shop has a punk rock feel too.

C YOGI BERRA*: When I sketched out the 10-greatest list, I had Johnny Bench written in ink and was ready to move on to other positions. Berra's 10 World Series titles and 14 American League pennants drew back to his stats just to check. Obviously, that caused me to reconsider. Bench, rightfully, gets a lot of play as the game's best all-time catcher. He has eight Gold Gloves, he backstopped the mighty Red Machine, and he hit 389 home runs in his career. It's hard to pick against him at this position, except Berra's accomplishments are just as impressive. They seem to be hidden by his character, his quotes and his role with the Second Yankee Dynasty. Look for yourself:
But the Vikings showed their resiliency against Fort Zumwalt East in the Class 4 District 8 championship game on Thursday by fighting back from a four-run, first-inning deficit and winning 5-4 at C&H Park.
