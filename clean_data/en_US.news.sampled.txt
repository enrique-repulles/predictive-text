There was no admission charge, no bleachers, no concession stand and no game programs. The fieldhouse on the Concordia campus in Clayton is named for the Preachers' longtime coach, the late Eldon "Pete" Pederson. I didn't know Pederson, but I remember him as an imposing figure when I attended Preachers games as a youngster in the late 1950s and early '60s. It was during that era when I was a neighborhood gym rat and got to serve as a ballboy for the St. Louis Hawks during their preseason camp at Concordia.

group of gentlemen who asked for half a shot of Drambuie and half a shot of Grand Marnier in a snifter," Ramsey says. "We soon realized their intention was to light said cocktail on fire, place their palm over the glass to extinguish the flame, then inhale the vapors (through a straw) and finally take their shot. Moral of the story? Don't light (stuff) on fire at the bar. We really don't take kindly to that."

To be sure, geopolitical realities dictate that the two allies do not view the situation identically. Unlike the United States, Israel lies in missile range of Iran's border, and that lent a greater sense of urgency to Netanyahu's remarks. For all the damage that economic sanctions have done to the Iranian economy, he said, "Iran's nuclear march goes on." While Obama advocates continuation of "diplomacy backed by pressure," his Israeli counterpart declares: "We've waited for diplomacy to work. We've waited for sanctions to work. None of us can afford to wait much longer. As prime minister of Israel, I will never let my people live under the shadow of annihilation."
I was pretty discouraged when we drove back to the inn. I had dragged my wife and son to a literal and figurative ghost town. As consolation, I told Sara we would pull over at the next stop promising lattes or cappuccinos (the only surefire way I know to talk my wife down from anger).

It had been a long time since Rodriguez performed such feats in front of a Yankee Stadium crowd. Including the ALDS, A-Rod had gone 48 at-bats without a home run in the Bronx. That came last season Sept. 4. His last three-hit game at the Stadium was June 12 last season. Of course, it didn’t help that Rodriguez, who battled a knee injury for much of 2011, hit .191 after the All-Star break last season. But his failure to deliver at the Stadium has made him the fans’ favorite scapegoat.

Esnault lets us slash the tops of some baguettes to release the gas, using his double-sided razor blade. Our baguettes are easy to spot, looking overly deflated compared to his.

2. Andrew Bynum. He's finally answered the bell on whether he can stay healthy. His post presence, footwork and aggressiveness improved so much that it only took a few games before Bryant proclaimed Bynum as the No. 2 guy in the team's pecking order. Considering the Lakers have a distinct size advantage, there's no reason to think that will change. Unless the Lakers don't pass enough inside, of course.

We are told to help all those that are in need and we are to be an example to every man and especially to all believers (1Timothy 4:12). I can pray for the rescue efforts in Japan and cast this care over to God (1Peter 5:7).

Which leads us to another aspect of St. Louis soccer-the merger of the Busch Soccer Club and Scott Gallagher Soccer Club to form St. Louis Scott Gallagher (SLSG). When these two powerhouse programs united it was thought to be for the greater good of St. Louis soccer. By not dividing the talent pool between them but joining them it would finally bring together the best of the best on one team. But it hasn't proven to be the case, at least not at the high school level.

Why: The Bretons are better known for reds from Chinon and Bourgeuil, but these Loire wizards have a deft hand with Chenin Blanc, too. "Sec" is pushing it a bit, as there's sweetness quietly sitting in the corner in the 2009. But the soapstone and spruce aromas, and a sweet pear and apricot profile, hit the balance so often lacking in Vouvray. Always crowd-pleasing and a perfect seafood foil.
